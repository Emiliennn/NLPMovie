    "### Introduction et objectifs du projet\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <u>Contexte :</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "L'analyse de sentiments est un domaine essentiel en science des données, en particulier en NLP. Elle utilise le machine learning et la linguistique pour détecter, extraire et étudier les émotions et les informations subjectives dans les textes sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dans le contexte des avis de films, l'analyse de sentiments permet de comprendre les perceptions et les émotions des spectateurs à partir de leurs commentaires, ce qui est précieux pour les critiques de films, les studios de cinéma et les plateformes de streaming.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <u>Objectifs :</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "Ce projet vise à développer une application interactive en Python permettant aux utilisateurs de demander des analyses de sentiments sur des films spécifiques. Les objectifs de l'application sont les suivants :\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Permettre aux utilisateurs de saisir un titre de film ou son ID pour récupérer des avis pertinents.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Analyser les sentiments exprimés dans ces avis, en calculant la polarité (positivité ou négativité des sentiments) et la subjectivité (mesure de l'opinion personnelle par rapport à un fait objectif) des commentaires.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Comparer les \"ratings\" (notes) des films avec la polarité des avis pour voir si les évaluations numériques correspondent aux sentiments exprimés dans les commentaires.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Examiner les différences, le cas échéant, entre les sentiments exprimés avant et après la sortie du film, fournissant ainsi une perspective unique sur l'évolution des perceptions des spectateurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <u>Méthodes de récupération des données :</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "Dans un premier temps, pour éviter de surcharger l'API de TMDB et de devoir gérer des bases de données trop volumineuses, nous avons décidé de limiter notre étude aux films sortis entre x et y. Une fois cette sélection effectuée, nous avons procédé à la récupération des données via 3 méthodes différentes :\n",
    "\n",
    "- L'API de TMDB : \"https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/\"\n",
    "- Scraping du site : imdb.com (via la librairie python : beautifulsoup4)\n",
    "- Utilisation de la librairie python : imdbpy\n",
    "\n",
    "L'objectif de cette section est de comparer les différentes méthodes de récupération des données afin de déterminer laquelle est la plus efficace et la plus pertinente pour notre projet.\n",
    "Dans une première approche il était question de tester les 3 méthodes, voir les avantages et inconvénients de chacune d'entre elles, de savoir si elles étaient complémentaires ou non, et de déterminer laquelle était la plus efficace et la plus pertinente pour notre projet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dans un second temps l'objectif est de structurer les données récupérées afin de pouvoir les exploiter dans la suite du projet. Si possible par une seule des méthodes de récupération des données mentionnées ci-dessus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensuite, il s'agira de mettre en place une méthode d'analyse de sentiments sur les commentaires récupérés, il existe des librairies python qui permettent de faire cela, mais il est également possible de créer notre propre méthode d'analyse de sentiments. \n",
    "\n",
    "Choix numéro 1 : Réaliser nos propres méthodes d'analyse de sentiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choix numéro 2 : Utiliser des librairies python existantes tel que : TextBlob, NLTK.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enfin il s'agira de mettre en place une application interactive en python permettant aux utilisateurs de demander des analyses de sentiments sur des films spécifiques.\n"

      "2010-07-24: The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate Ellis \"Red\" Redding (Freeman). While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them.There was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film back in 94, with a title that didn't give much inkling to anyone about what it was about, and with Columbia Pictures unsure how to market it, Shawshank Redemption barely registered at the box office. However, come Academy Award time the film received several nominations, and although it won none, it stirred up interest in the film for its home entertainment release. The rest, as they say, is history. For the film finally found an audience that saw the film propelled to almost mythical proportions as an endearing modern day classic. Something that has delighted its fans, whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors. One thing is for sure, though, is that which ever side of the Shawshank fence you sit on, the film continues to gather new fans and simply will never go away or loose that mythical status.It's possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the film into cinematic spasms. The implausible plot and an apparent sentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life, are but two chief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion. Yet when characters are this richly drawn, and so movingly performed, it strikes me as churlish to do down a human drama that's dealing in hope, friendship and faith. The sentimental aspect is indeed there, but that acts as a counterpoint to the suffering, degradation and shattering of the soul involving our protagonist. Cosy prison life you say? No chance. The need for human connection is never more needed than during incarceration, surely? And given the quite terrific performances of Robbins (never better) & Freeman (sublimely making it easy), it's the easiest thing in the world to warm to Andy and Red.Those in support aren't faring too bad either. Bob Gunton is coiled spring smarm as Warden Norton, James Whitmore is heart achingly great as the \"Birdman Of Shawshank,\" Clancy Brown is menacing as antagonist Capt. Byron Hadley, William Sadler amusing as Heywood & Mark Rolston is impressively vile as Bogs Diamond. Then there's Roger Deakins' lush cinematography as the camera gracefully glides in and out of the prison offering almost ethereal hope to our characters (yes, they are ours). The music pings in conjunction with the emotional flow of the movie too. Thomas Newman's score is mostly piano based, dovetailing neatly with Andy's state of mind, while the excellently selected soundtrack ranges from the likes of Hank Williams to the gorgeous Le Nozze di Figaro by Mozart.If you love Shawshank then it's a love that lasts a lifetime. Every viewing brings the same array of emotions - anger - revilement - happiness - sadness - inspiration and a warmth that can reduce the most hardened into misty eyed wonderment. Above all else, though, Shawshank offers hope - not just for characters in a movie - but for a better life and a better world for all of us. 10/10.\n",
      "\n",
      "2021-02-17: It is no wonder that the film has such a high rating, it is quite literally breathtaking. What can I say that hasn't said before? Not much, it's the story, the acting, the premise, but most of all, this movie is about how it makes you feel. Sometimes you watch a film, and can't remember it days later, this film loves with you, once you've seen it, you don't forget.The ultimate story of friendship, of hope, and of life, and overcoming adversity.I understand why so many class this as the best film of all time, it isn't mine, but I get it. If you haven't seen it, or haven't seen it for some time, you need to watch it, it's amazing. 10/10.\n",
      "\n",
      "2005-11-21: I'm trying to save you money; this is the last film title that you should consider borrowing. Renting Shawshank will cost you five bucks... just plunk down the $25 and own the title. You'll wind up going back to this gem time and time again. This is one of few movies that are truly timeless. And it's entertaining and moving, no matter how many times you view it.Forget about what others (including myself) might suggest you'll discover in \"The Shawshank Redemption;\" when you watch it, you'll identify something very personal in your own life with a scene, a character, or a moment in this uncomplicated movie. When you need hope, you'll look for Shawshank. When you want to believe in the will of overcoming even the greatest obstacles, Shawshank will uplift you in ways that you can't find in movies today. Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening. Of course, some can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and Faith in humanity, but most places of worship are open only certain days or times. But when you need affirmation of the lasting bond of friendships that prevail over the most dire circumstances, Shawshank will give it to you. It makes grown men (like me) cry, still. I wonder whether Shawshank was truly meant for viewing in the privacy of the home, because it is a personal experience that really makes you look inward. Nominated for seven, this is the best film that never one a single Oscar. How ironic that an innocent man winds up being surrounded by the corruption of the legal system. Shawshank itself is similar to the character of Andy Dufresne. Prejudging this classic film, critics couldn't get past the title. The public followed suit, initially dismissing Shawshank, which failed in the box office just like \"It's a Wonderful Life\" and \"Citizen Kane.\" It could have just whithered away on the store shelves, like Andy Dufresne could have in his own cell. But the characters prevailed, because Andy -- And Shawshank -- stayed true. Now, these movies are right up there as the most popular films of all time. Anyone who has yet to watch Shawshank may be so jaded of movies, or the film's title, or how a 2-1/2- hour movie set inside the walls of a prison can manage to tap the soul of such a wide range of people. Shawshank has not one explosion. I wonder if it even has a single special effect or digitally- enhanced frame. But every aspect of Shawshank fit together. The acting from the top to the bit part. The musical score. The editing. The photography. The story, from opening credits to final scene. All involved, including the town of Mansfield, Ohio (where Shawshank was actually filmed) played their roles perfectly. Shawshank is a must- see, must- own title.\n",
      "\n",
      "2008-02-18: This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was inspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just made me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Red's group. James Whitmore also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been \"institutionalized\". The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance. Whatever you do, don't listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies ever. It has everything you could possibly want.\n",

It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate Ellis \"Red\" Redding (Freeman). While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film back in 94, with a title that didn\\'t give much inkling to anyone about what it was about, and with Columbia Pictures unsure how to market it, Shawshank Redemption barely registered at the box office. However, come Academy Award time the film received several nominations, and although it won none, it stirred up interest in the film for its home entertainment release. The rest, as they say, is history. For the film finally found an audience that saw the film propelled to almost mythical proportions as an endearing modern day classic. Something that has delighted its fans, whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors. One thing is for sure, though, is that which ever side of the Shawshank fence you sit on, the film continues to gather new fans and simply will never go away or loose that mythical status.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the film into cinematic spasms. The implausible plot and an apparent sentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life, are but two chief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion. Yet when characters are this richly drawn, and so movingly performed, it strikes me as churlish to do down a human drama that\\'s dealing in hope, friendship and faith. The sentimental aspect is indeed there, but that acts as a counterpoint to the suffering, degradation and shattering of the soul involving our protagonist. Cosy prison life you say? No chance. The need for human connection is never more needed than during incarceration, surely? And given the quite terrific performances of Robbins (never better) & Freeman (sublimely making it easy), it\\'s the easiest thing in the world to warm to Andy and Red.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose in support aren\\'t faring too bad either. Bob Gunton is coiled spring smarm as Warden Norton, James Whitmore is heart achingly great as the \"Birdman Of Shawshank,\" Clancy Brown is menacing as antagonist Capt. Byron Hadley, William Sadler amusing as Heywood & Mark Rolston is impressively vile as Bogs Diamond. Then there\\'s Roger Deakins\\' lush cinematography as the camera gracefully glides in and out of the prison offering almost ethereal hope to our characters (yes, they are ours). The music pings in conjunction with the emotional flow of the movie too. Thomas Newman\\'s score is mostly piano based, dovetailing neatly with Andy\\'s state of mind, while the excellently selected soundtrack ranges from the likes of Hank Williams to the gorgeous Le Nozze di Figaro by Mozart.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you love Shawshank then it\\'s a love that lasts a lifetime. Every viewing brings the same array of emotions - anger - revilement - happiness - sadness - inspiration and a warmth that can reduce the most hardened into misty eyed wonderment. Above all else, though, Shawshank offers hope - not just for characters in a movie - but for a better life and a better world for all of us. 10/10', 'created_at': '2016-07-10T00:16:50.561Z', 'id': '578193f29251417c28001764', 'updated_at': '2021-06-23T15:57:48.710Z', 'url': 'https://www.themoviedb.org/review/578193f29251417c28001764'}, {'author': 'tmdb73913433', 'author_details': {'name': '', 'username': 'tmdb73913433', 'avatar_path': None, 'rating': 6.0}, 'content': 'Make way for the best film ever made people. **Make way.**', 'created_at': '2017-11-11T15:09:34.114Z', 'id': '5a0712aec3a3687914014a4b', 'updated_at': '2021-06-23T15:58:02.682Z', 'url': 'https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5a0712aec3a3687914014a4b'}, {'author': 'thommo_nz', 'author_details': {'name': '', 'username': 'thommo_nz', 'avatar_path': None, 'rating': 10.0}, 'content': 'There is a reason why this movie is at the top of any popular list your will find.\\r\\nVery strong performances from lead actors and a story line from the literary brilliance of Stephen King (and no, its not a horror).\\r\\nSufficient drama and depth to keep you interested and occupied without stupefying your brain.

The film is set over a period of over ten years, and depicts some of the most brutal aspects of prison life; but also some it\\'s more hopeful. It deals with violence and desperation but also of bonding and lasting friendships and loyalties that long term close-confinement engender. Frank Darabont elicits the best from his three principals superbly, with added venom provided by guard captain Clancy Brown and humanity from prison librarian James Whitmore - one of the few who actually does make parole.

       "     'content': '“The Batman” Is A Very Engaging And Unforgettable Tale That Is One Of The Best Adaptations Of The Character Ever\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1989 Michael Keaton was seen as a very controversial choice to wear the Cowl of Batman but soon proved his doubters wrong by turning “Batman” and its subsequent sequel “Batman Returns” into massive Box Office success before leaving the cape behind.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile four other actors have taken up the cinematic version of the character in the subsequent years, Keaton has remained for many the Gold Standard with Christian Bale likely being his biggest rival.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Robert Pattinson was named as the new Batman, there was interest but concern as an actor who is largely known for playing Edward in the “Twilight” films seemed to be an odd choice. However, I would say that anyone who has seen some of his recent work including his performance in “The Lighthouse” would be playing him a disservice by saying he was not up to the part.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn “The Batman”, audiences are given a darker and more broken Bruce Wayne, an Emo recluse who is far from the Socialite he has been portrayed as for decades and a very sullen and withdrawn individual who does not exude charm or grace and even shows issues making eye-contact.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the Mayor of Gotham is killed shortly before the election by a mysterious individual known as “The Riddler” (Paul Dano), the vigilante known as “The Batman” is called in to help the police by Lt. James Gordon (Jeffrey Wright).  Gordon has been working with Batman for some time but it is clear that his association with him has not won him any favors with his fellow officers, many of which openly question his use and involvement in the crime scenes.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurther complicating matters are clues left at the various crime locales that are addressed to The Batman and cause many to believe that he may be working with the very killer they are attempting to stop.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the investigation unfolds, the seedy side of Gotham City comes to light in the form of a missing girl who was photographed with the married Mayor and may well be the key to the investigation. Her disappearance leads her friend Selina Kyle (Zoe Kravitz), to take on her Catwoman persona and delve deep into an underworld that features deadly individuals ranging from Carmine Falcone (John Turturro), and The Penguin (Colin Farrell), amongst others as she and the Batman conduct their own investigations that at times overlap and further complicate matters.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the body count rises and Batman races to find the true method behind the madness of The Riddler, the tone becomes darker and more sinister in a deadly race against time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film eschews the usual abundance of action sequences and glossy special effects which are common for Comic Book related films and instead gives audiences a slow-burning murder mystery that holds your attention from start to finish over its three-hour run time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dark and foreboding tone of the film is brought home by the haunting and sharp piano keys of the film’s theme that permeates the film and punches home that this is a film clearly aimed at a more adult audience.\\r\\n\\r\\nPattinson does a great job showing the deeply broken individual that is behind the mask and that Batman is the only form of escape or therapy that Bruce Wayne has due to his insistence on saving a city that many argue cannot be saved. He has strained his relationship at times with Alfred (Andy Serkis), caused damage to the financial stability and reputation of the family company in his quest for vengeance and justice, and has become a bitter and broken recluse in doing so. In many ways, it could be argued that his only socialization with others is as The Batman and his single-minded obsession is chilling to watch.\\r\\n\\r\\nPattinson also handles the action sequences well as the film spaces them out to put the emphasis more on the man than the gadgets as they are kept to a minimum even during a thrilling chase with the new version of The Batmobile.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe strong supporting cast works well with the film and Paul Dano gives a very compelling and disturbing version of his character which makes the film even darker and more engrossing.\\r\\n\\r\\nDirector Matt Reeves has crafted a dark and foreboding tone and visual style as a good portion of the film takes place in the darkness and his screenplay is not afraid to take chances by putting the emphasis on the characters and their flaws versus an abundance of action and effects.\\r\\n\\r\\nI found this version of the character and interpretation more engrossing than prior versions of the film as the bold move to do a slow-burning and dark murder mystery versus an effect-laden action film reminded me of some of the better Batman stories such as Batman: The Killing Joke or Batman: The Long Halloween.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film is not going to be for everyone, especially younger viewers and some may take issue with the casting choices, but their performances shine and as such, “The Batman” was a very engaging and unforgettable tale that for me serves as one of the best adaptations of the character ever.\\r\\n\\r\\n4 stars out of 5',\n",

       "     'content': \"The reviews and hype for this movie were massive!  Comparisons to The Dark Knight got my expectations high... probably a little too high.  I was expecting to be blown away and was not but even with that being said The Batman is an exceptional film.  The cinematography and visuals are stunning.  Matt Reeves made some genius creative choices among which were the more reclusive rockstar grungy Bruce Wayne and the Riddler being heavily influenced by the Zodiac.  The acting was fantastic as well with Zoe Kravitz and Paul Dano offering some standout performances.  The Batman is driven with psychological and mystery focus as compared to the action comedy style of most superhero movies.  My only complaint is that the mystery felt fairly predictable.  I wasn't surprised by any of the twists and turns.  Ultimately, this was a wonderful addition to the Batman franchise and I can't wait to see where it goes next.\",\n",

       "     'content': 'Paul Dano and Colin Farrell are extraordinary, but _The Batman_ is a three hour slog through Gotham that culminates with an over exaggerated riddle that isn’t worth solving. Having Batman and Jim Gordon both speak in raspy, whispery grunts feels excessive as does Gordon’s insistence on calling Batman, “Chief,” every time that they’re together. The film deserves credit for prominently shining the spotlight on the underbelly of crime in Gotham, but the storytelling in _The Batman_ is a lot like Bugs Bunny meaning to have taken that left turn at Albuquerque; a meandering foray down a dark rabbit hole that isn’t entirely necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Full review:** https://hubpages.com/entertainment/The-Batman-2022-Review-When-is-a-Bat-Not-Quite-a-Bat',\n",

       "     'content': '_**\"Our scars can destroy us, even after the physical wounds have healed. But if we survive them, they can transform us. They can give us the power to endure, and the strength to fight.\"**_\\r\\n\\r\\nEver since it was announced that Matt Reeves was going to direct The Batman after Ben Affleck stepped down for personal reasons, I had no doubt he was going to put on one hell of a masterpiece. This is the definitive live-action Batman. An epic 3-hour film noir that delves deep into comic lore of Gotham City.\\r\\n\\r\\nRobert Pattinson perfectly embodies both Bruce Wayne and Batman. I love the character arc he goes through, realizing Gotham doesn\\'t need vengeance to heal, but hope. Zoë Kravitz plays a phenomenal Selina Kyle, you actually feel her emotions throughout the movie. Another plus is that she actually feels integral to the plot (unlike The Dark Knight Rises). Paul Dano is a terrifyingly realistic interpretation of The Riddler, using the internet to gain a fan base for his sick games. Andy Serkis plays an excellent Alfred, being Bruce\\'s emotional support during Dark times.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe soundtrack by Michael Giacchino is absolute God-Tier. Elevating every scene with emotion and sometimes dread. Finally a score to rival Danny Elfman\\'s iconic score. Matt Reeves direction is impeccable as always, getting some nice shots while also making it feel nice and claustrophobic around Batman.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, a God-Tier Batman movie that I can\\'t wait for the Cinematic Universe that\\'s being made around it as I type this.',\n",

       "     'content': 'It\\'s a cracker, no doubt about it!\\r\\n\\r\\nMatt Reeves did a great job with 2022\\'s <em>\\'The Batman\\'</em>. It\\'s difficult not to compare this to other Batman films, though that\\'s DC/Warner Bros. fault for featuring him so much in recent times. I\\'ll get this out the way early: I\\'d say <em>\\'<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/batman-begins/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Batman Begins</a>\\'</em>/\\'<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-dark-knight/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Dark Knight</a>\\'</em> are superior, not by much, which is a similar case for the character performances too.\\r\\n\\r\\nRobert Pattinson is a terrific Bruce Wayne, though Christian Bale still edges him out in my eyes. Zoë Kravitz is probably the best Catwoman I\\'ve seen, though the rest - from the Riddler to Penguin to Alfred - have been portrayed better; aside from Commissioner Gordon, with Jeffrey Wright being excellent. Paul Dano is the least enjoyable performer, for me, here, I found his showing to be a bit \\'meh\\' - effective, but meh. Barry Keoghan makes a cameo, I won\\'t say as who, but I don\\'t hold high hopes for him in that role; though, <a href=\"https://variety.com/2022/film/news/the-batman-ending-joker-barry-keoghan-matt-reeves-1235196812/#:~:text=While%20it%20may,more%20%E2%80%9CBatman%E2%80%9D%20movies.\" rel=\"nofollow\">apparently</a> it won\\'t be anything that happens anyway. For the best!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnyway... the above sounds <em>way</em> too negative - as I did thoroughly and absolutely enjoy this film, hence the very positive rating. The pacing is very good, the cinematography is brilliant (Gotham looks fantastically bleak!), the story is engrossing and the dialogue is on point. The scenes with Pattinson/Kravitz and Pattinson/Wright are my favourite moments. It\\'s a film that I\\'d consider as \\'outstanding\\'.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'ll be cool to see what Reeves does with this trilogy (should it happen, of course).',\n",

       "     'content': 'I like how Batman is depicted with a naive and loser POV from his rich high tower, a rich trust fund baby called out by both sane (Catwoman) and insane (Riddler) people while he remains oblivious until the consequences are literally flooding the city. While he uses the idea of Batman as a mantle for him to process trauma, his obliviousness to his own celebrity status and image creates unintentional side effects from his parents\\' death hogging the spotlight away from the people that mattered to his own nebulous idea of \"vengeance\" being co-opted by the goons, a heel-turn realization that eventually changes the rack focus, ultimately leading to a wider perspective and a selfless act of cutting the cord and helping others. Hope is more important than his idea of justice, in the end, empathy being the missing piece throughout. Instead of being a voyeur like Riddler during his master plan (Riddler binoculars on the mayor, Batman binoculars on Catwoman), he switches to being on the ground to help, no longer from his high castle.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s interesting how this arc plays out. At the beginning, it plays into this \"badass\" idea comic book fans love to gloat about Batman of striking fear into crime, but the way it\\'s portrayed is frightening to everyone. It\\'s a better criticism of Batman\\'s fascism than BvS was going for, showcasing his fear to people who don\\'t even deserve it, such as kids doing vandalism who probably believe the system is failing them, but to him at the beginning crime all looks the same.\\r\\n\\r\\nHonestly this film goes harder than Phantasm on the tragedy that is Bruce Wayne. They\\'re inseparable by choice, to the point that Bruce basically is Batman even when not in the costume, a social recluse who can barely function in real life, listening to emo music and having rings around his eyes, a night owl to the extreme. The struggle is there even as Batman, literally smashing his face on a truck.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are some contradictions throughout thematically, however. It\\'s weird how it goes between \"it\\'s the WHOLE system, all cops are pigs\" to \"it\\'s just bad apples\" simultaneously, displaying a somewhat cringe centrism. Catwoman by the end basically points it more to systemic (and Batman and Thomas Wayne\\'s criticism of thinking they know better and actually makings things worse isn\\'t undercut, which by itself is also institutional criticism), although it still feels like they could\\'ve done more. Maybe out of their hands by the studio or this as far as they could get away with vs. the producers (it almost felt like a struggle for Catwoman to outline her \"eat the rich\" mentality). Gotham itself is a mess of contradictions and it\\'s OK to let the viewer lie between it all I guess.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso the relationship between Catwoman and Batman is kinda slimy and male-centric. Catwoman, while great as a character, functionally falls to Batman\\'s controlling force with a forced romance in the second act. Sure they\\'re both suffering from trauma but Batman was literally using her despite it all, it at least understands the power gap more in the third act.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe end of the second act also spins its wheels a bit too much, the mystery pace kinda suffers a bit from focus and scenes get too drawn out (Riddler just disappears for a while). The movie could\\'ve been 20 minutes shorter. Doesn\\'t stop it from having a terrific third act since most blockbusters have kinda sucked on that note\\r\\nAlthough speaking of Riddler, master class. Probably my favorite villain in a Batman film. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe aesthetic was gorgeous. I love its color grading and architecture, still thinking of the Wayne tower and its metal grates, goth hallways, and insane attention to detail that gets blurred out intentionally in the frame for most of the movie by Bruce\\'s obliviousness to the world. It also keeps a balance of evoking the black/white movies while still being colorful, more of flooded black and oranges. I think of that sequence with Penguin not mainly for the fight itself (which to me was a bit messy) but moreso the flooded orange of the fire being the only color creating a sorta gradient on the black car, and how the flare at the end matches that aesthetic, that one color illuminating Batman leading everybody else to exit the frame, like a light in the darkness. Lovely\\r\\n\\r\\nThe music.... Giacchino just beat out his Incredibles score for me, masterful work with motifs, percussion, and rhythm. His mastery of percussion and horns during the lights out Batman hallway fight and how the horns blast, how well edited the percussion beat subtly goes through the Penguin chase and other fight sequences, Batman doesn\\'t quite have a dance like Hong Kong films but the music makes it come close. The timpani and strings are so well used!!! Great use of Ave Maria both as soundtrack and score. Catwoman\\'s motif? Amazing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe performances are great all around. Finally a film with Turturro that I don\\'t hate him. He\\'s well restrained and perfectly cast, his dickish attitude now a strong point making him very memorable with very little screen time, much like Farrell in the same film. Kravitz made me the closest to tearing up with how she visually handles conflicting emotions, I still think about that scene with the voicemail where her eyes are all over the place and has trouble keeping it all together. Dano as Riddler is terrific.\\r\\n\\r\\nYep, this is my fav Batman film now.',\n",

       "     'content': \"This film is so intricate, there's so many details, things you can obverse on multiple watches and not have noticed on your first. There's a lot of things that just aren't spoken that give this film so much substance. So many layers and nuanced story telling. Gotham City feels as it should, as it's own character and a visceral cesspool of corruption and just dirt. It feels dirty, unpolished... it's amazing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere's so many shots in this film that are just simply breathtaking and intentionally dirty. It helps capture this visceral tone and fits substantially well with the universe of Batman.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing a diehard fan of Batman for, like, pretty much all of my life- I have to say; Matt Reeves absolutely nailed it with a completely faithful adaptation of Batman. Not once in this movie did he do something I felt was completely out of character and Robert Pattinson solidified the performance of both Bruce Wayne and the Batman. I love Matt Reeves went to the extent to make sure this Batman doesn't kill, as other directors have seem to give less care to. Yes, even Nolan. It should have to go without saying that Batman does not kill, that's a no-brainer, but for decades this has been a problem in Batman films... and finally, it no longer is a problem. That's how you do it.\\r\\n\\r\\nBringing this review to a conclusion, this is easily my favourite Batman film. So many things about this film just feel like it's pulled straight out of a comic book. I mean, Riddler flooding the city itself is pulled straight from Zero Year and there's so many nods to comic moments and members of Batman's rouges gallery. Matt Reeves knew what he was doing, and he crafted this film for diehard Batman fans, succeeding immensely. Can't wait to see more of this universe.\",\n",

       "     'content': '> Enormous mass that is per se a riddle. Forget screenplay, it\\'s a comic storyboard; Do you remember Rorschach, from Moore\\'s Watchmen, ruminating in the sewers?, ok, transpolate Batman and it works! No way, here I go-monologue and comic dialogues (effective and practical like instant soup, with 2 percent protein), comic narration, that is functional, utilitarian, Bentham would say, with the ellipses and any speech or reasoning that requires 2 minutes of reflection, at most!, \"\"this whole city´s gonna come apart\" says a District Attorney, scenic cuts and messy complexity...-entertaining but messy-comic, etc, ...it is a comic turned into a movie by someone who - I\\'m speculating, any resemblance to reality is purely by chance - was advised or made, or made comics in his life, don\\'t you believe me? Ellipsis of all ellipses: \"Alfred, you\\'re not my father \"At 23 minutes of tape, all the conflict of identity and belonging, as well as the purpose of the hero, under the sieve of the most selfish and mean son of millionaires, but let\\'s forget this, let\\'s continue. A Batman beating Kurt\\'s velvety drum Cobain, -didn\\'t tell the subversive c revolutionary adence of Cobain, to think like that I would have to know that grunge swept hardrock -finally in the 90s- and buried Motley Crue, Guns and Roses and others, (yes, I mentioned him, Cobain, and not Nirvana that did not exist, that\\'s why when we die we are left without this specific type of grunge, I already digressed, anyway) but yes, this Batman is doubly omniscient, an ego the size of Gotham City authorizes him (a) not only to -his first omniscience- speaking in the first person of himself when running the plot, that is to say in the events, \"I am revenge\" he says to the subway gang members, (scene that is not better than Todd Phillips\\' Koker subway, for give another example) that this happened -the first person- almost in all the other versions that precede it,it is also included here -its omniscience, obviously- dominating forensic or medical terms: \"eschimia\"? ask Batman of course!, but to (b), his second omniscience, being the narrator of his exploits in the first person, this again leads us to an Alan Moore influence but, with all due respect, as a clericot of Alan\\'s genius Moore. When Batman wants to see the Penguin, he just has to be like the Penguin, appear in the doorway and announce himself, and please, for the fun of the plot, Batman almost spouts a sentence \"please tell me you won\\'t let me in to unfold my money in the form of weapons hidden in my suit, and get in anyway. That is to say, the theatricality and the shadows of the bat, remained in the Babyboomer Generation or Generation X when the entrance was an \"appearance\" through shadows, suspicion and myth. The film is a complex mass because it is as if The Batman, The Batman 2 and 3 had been compressed and I am not only talking about the exhausting time of almost 3 hours, but also because of the number of common threads in which it was woven into a single feature film. For example, the plot increases its complexity first with a Riddler who is an anti-hero, because he indirectly helps Batman and the supposed common good and because of the premises that justify his murders, unmasking the big shots of the underworld at high levels of government, but later, arrested as Edward Nashton, he unmasks himself, that is, he turns himself in, sitting in that cafeteria just when, then yes, we will understand his \"fine\" intentions, and he becomes a true public order villain because he incites the revenge to the uncritical masses and followers of the disorder who have suffered or have resentments for any type of discrimination or corruption that they have suffered in Gotham city, (no more and no less than similar to the end of Todd Phillips\\' Joker);another complexity is with the cat The cat, I will not say Catwoman, who has her own drama for Kyle and at some point Batman leans on her, to spy on the Prosecutor and at least 2 times saves her from murdering her father Carmine Falcone and the his father\\'s henchman. On the other hand, there is the added density or complexity of transcending and publishing the videos that show that the mother of Bruce Wayne, the mother of Batman had psychiatric problems in Arkham and hospitals and comes from a family that descendants who also had these difficulties and Thomas Wayne , trying to silence the journalist, he used the biggest thug Falcone. In other words, there is a possibility that Falcone, Catwoman\\'s stepfather, is the one who murdered the Waynes that night because Batman\\'s father was about to pity or denounce the next day that he only wanted to silence the journalist and NOT murder him as Falcone did. . In short, it is entertaining but poorly planned for a single feature film due to the enormous amount of detail that is handled.',\n",

       "     'content': 'OK, shoot me now - but you can tell when you are watching a film at the cinema and the audience start to get a bit restless. Well mine did with this overlong, and frankly rather dreary film. The opening few, somewhat dystopian, scenes reminded me of \"Blade Runner\" (1982) and we do hit the ground running. Amidst an hotly contested mayoral election, a chap in a gas mask (\"The Riddler\", we learn later) brutally takes out the sitting candidate enticing the \"Batman\" (Robert Pattinson) to come help his policeman pal \"Gordon\" (Jeffrey Wright) to investigate. Seems that the killer wanted that to happen because he leaves our caped crusader a card with a clue. Soon the great and the good of the city are dropping like flies and a web of corruption and deceit at the top echelons of government is emerging. Personally I found this all a bit dull. It flows terribly slowly, and after a while the relentless darkness and a really pretty soporific, moody, effort from Pattinson just started to bore me. There are loads of plot holes - not least just how the \"Riddler\" manages to pull off some pretty heavy duty crimes without having to scale any tall buildings, or sneak past the heavily guarded victims of his spree. The scenes with the completely unprotected DA (Peter Sarsgaard) in a dimly lit street are just plain daft. Colin Farrell is probably my highlight as the duplicitous \"Oz\", and Zoë Kravitz (\"Cat Woman”) offers us some decent acrobatics but otherwise, this is an hugely over-rated affair that has a serious paucity of dialogue, is heavily scored and during it\\'s almost three hours, not enough actually happens. Indeed, it is very reluctant to let us leave. I will admit that my first guess at the ending was a bit optimistic, but it could conclude at least another four times before we are finally allowed to stretch our legs. It might look better second time around, but for now it\\'s nothing at all to write home about.',\n",

       "     'content': 'I am so tired of superhero movies. Still, being down with a mild case of Corona, I wanted something to watch that\\'d go down easy, and The Batman was available, so I picked it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have to say that this, to me, is one of the rare superhero movies that appeal to me. And that\\'s after having seen every other Batman movie since Tim Burton\\'s 1989 one. And, I dare say, even with me being fed up with superhero movies, I think this is the best attempt.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt three hours, it feels like binge-watching a three-part miniseries. And by that I mean both that to the extent that it is three acts, they almost perfectly align with an hour each, and also that the pacing is great, and I never got bored.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cast is excellent. Also, for the first time ever, I\\'m not thinking that it\\'s ridiculous that no one recognizes Bruce Wayne as Batman. The half-mask actually makes Bruce Wayne unrecognizable. I\\'m not sure if they thought of that during casting, but it\\'s really quite impressive.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s also nice to not have to suffer through a pathetic attempt from Batman to make his voice sound cool. Oh dear, Christian Bale trying to look and sound cool was just so cringey. Robert Pattinson is by far the best Batman I\\'ve ever seen. The almost depressive mental torment he conveys does not come off as fake or pretension, and that\\'s a first for the Batman franchise as far as I\\'m concerned.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mood is bleak without being depressive, the score is fantastic, if a bit too much, the cinematography is amazing, I really have very little to fault here. If anything, it may come off as a little pretentious and self-indulgent, but that\\'s also part of the attraction, and if I\\'m being completely honest, I think it\\'s more to do with my own \"people need to grow up and stop watching these childish things\" prejudice I have, when in fact the 15-year-old inside of me f...ing loves it, and I need to embrace that childish part of me rather than hate on it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf there\\'s anything I would change about this movie, it\\'s what I feel is somewhat of a PG-ification of Batman. I would love to see this movie with all its bleak desperation and lust for vengeance on the depravity and evil in the Gotham world, but with a seriously anti-hero, all-violent, bringer-of-death Batman. I would love to see him - in a more crude outfit, with less bells and whistles, and definitely without the cape - destroy, slay and kill, with exploration of the terrible aftermath it would bring, including the impact on his psyche, rather than the beat-up-and-let-go strategy that he is using in this movie. That part just feels to not align with both the doomish mood that sets the story and the seeming existential depression of our masked protagonist. I think that would warrant yet another installment in this franchise. I\\'m actually surprised how much meat there is on this character.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, if the movie overall is consistently a bit too much, the ending takes it one notch further on that scale.\\r\\n\\r\\nRegardless, I now have two superhero movies that I keep in my movie collection. The other is Watchmen (Director\\'s Cut).\\r\\n\\r\\n1 star deducted for Catwoman being racist without it being presented as a problem. The casting of her is perfect, by the way. Much better than Michelle Pfeiffer.',\n",

       "     'content': 'Oh boy, yet another review here on TMDB about this movie. What is it about comic books that garners so much interest? I am no longer a comic hero fan, either in movies or the source comic books. I have seen some of the Marvel series and the only one that I would watch multiple times if it came across my screen in Ant Man and the Wasp, with its wit, action and humor.\\r\\n\\r\\nI did read superhero comics as a kid, however. I stuck to DC comics. I especially liked the Legion of Superheroes, though I also read the Justice League, Superman and Batman. This was the Silver Age of comics, I believe, before they restarted and complicated the field with reimagining the comic universe (or whatever it is they did).\\r\\n\\r\\nAnyway, I was a DC boy so I gave The Batman a look see. It is a dark film, both in its themes and its camera work. No wit and humor to speak of here, just grim and introspective comic book noir. But it was intriguing and interesting enough to hold only my attention. There were a couple of interesting twists on traditional Batman villains, for example. As with a lot of current thrillers, there is quite a body count, when sometimes with violence, I think less can be more.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not a film I will watch multiple times or anxiously await a sequel for, but I do not regret the time spent watching it.',\n",

       "     'content': '_The Batman_ is the best live-action Batman movie yet. It\\'s the type of Batman film I\\'ve been waiting for my whole life.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s dark and realistic, but also stylish and large-scale. It\\'s not limited by a commitment to realism like the Dark Knight trilogy, nor is it burdened by a shared universe like the DCEU. It is its own thing. A moody, disturbing, visually stunning, David Fincher-inspired, three hour long detective epic with some of the best interpretations of the characters ever put on screen.\\r\\n\\r\\nRobert Pattinson is fantastic as a younger, moodier, and yes, more emo Batman. Paul Dano is straight up terrifying as the Riddler. Colin Farrell is unrecognisable in more ways than one as The Penguin and Zoë Kravitz is easily my favorite live-action Catwoman. Massively underrated is john Turturro as Carmine Falcone.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis movie kept me hooked all the way through. It\\'s almost three hours long but it feels like two.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the best Batman movie. The Dark Knight is good and all, but Reeves finds the perfect mix of gritty realism and style (Nolan would never even dare to have a snorricam shot of Batmam gliding over the city), and finally gives us a live-action Batman that lives up to the title of \"World\\'s Greatest Detective\".

I really had problems writing this review because it is a very good movie. I just did not like it as a Batman movie.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe movie is really dark, gritty and noir. Not really a problem. It works for some movies. But it is also quite slow at the beginning and the first quarter of the movie was actually boring. Remember, this is a three hour movie so a quarter is more than half an hour of “boringness”.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe “boringess” was broken up by a pretty cool car chase. Some people seem to not really like the batmobile and I have to say that it was not very inspired but it was not all bad either. Unfortunately the movie turned rather boring for a while again after that.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe movie tries to bring out more of the detective part of Batman than the previous movies, which is fine, but there is just too much moping around with Batman / Bruce Wayne walking around oozing sadness all around him.\\r\\n\\r\\nActually, this brings us to my main gripe with this movie. The choice of actor for the Batman is just wrong for me. He is more like a sad puppy than the Batman. The script that makes him mope around, have emotional outbreaks and, occasionally, being downright stupid like just staring dumbfounded when explosives go off in his face does not really help of course.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo me the Selina Kyle character had more charisma than the Batman, especially when the Batman was in his Bruce Wayne alter ego.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I really, really dislike that twist about Bruce’s parents. That was such a lazy Hollywood writer hack thing to do just to create (unwanted) drama.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen we have the Riddler. Compared to the charismatic villains that we have come to expect he is just a sad little psychopath with a bunch of equally sad fanatical internet followers.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, all of this would have worked great if it had been a movie about some, unspecified, vigilante. The movie is really well done. The detective story, the action (especially towards the end) and the noir setting would have worked great. Even at its three hour bloated length it would have been great although cut down to two hours or a bit more would have been even better. If it had not been a Batman movie!',\n",

       "     'content': \"The Batman is not a terribly bad movie, but it would be twice as good if it were half as long. How a film that likes to take shortcuts – especially with the Riddler’s ‘riddles’ – can still take almost three hours to get to where it’s going, I haven’t the foggiest (but then this is a rather strange enterprise that gives us Andy Serkis in the flesh and covers Colin Farrell in prosthetic makeup and a fat suit). Director/co-writer Matt Reeves very wisely avoids origin stories and takes for granted relationships, which have already been well established in a decades-long canon, between certain characters; on the other hand, he allows his movie to become bogged down at the halfway point in a deluge of backstory.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe obvious problem is that there is enough material here for at least two films, and Reeves attempts to cram it all into a single one. Why? We all know there are going to be sequels, so why not save some for the next chapter? Or better yet, why not leave some of it on the cutting room floor? There is absolutely no reason for the Penguin to be in this movie; he might as well be the Imperceptible Man (an actual Batman villain, mind you) for all that he’s given to do. Catwoman has been pretty much played out, and as far as the Riddler, I can’t believe I’m going to say this, but Jim Carrey did a much better job with the role than does Paul Dano – an otherwise fine actor that inexplicably chose to play the character as the bastard child of Heath Ledger’s Joker and Tom Hardy’s Bane. That leaves Carmine Falcone (John Turturro), who provides the most intriguing plot points; why not make him the main, or even – dare I say it – only villain?\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, The Batman is long enough to try the patient of a saint, but at least it’s great to look at. Like the first Tim Burton Batman (as described by the unerring Roger Ebert), it “is a triumph of design over story, style over substance - a great-looking movie with a plot you can’t care much about.” Gotham City in particular is a winning combination of Burton’s faux noir texture and Christopher Nolan’s plausible architecture. The best scenes involve Batman (Robert Pattinson) and Jim Gordon (Jeffrey Wright) – and indeed Pattinson has an uncanny knack for playing off veteran character actors – as a sort of pre-Robin dynamic duo; their adventures are poignant because they appear to happen in the real world, or at least as real as a world can be wherein a grown man disguises himself as a giant bat (compare last year’s Zack Snyder's Justice League, with its unending CGI assault on the senses).\",\n",

       "     'content': \"This was the worst Batman I have ever seen. \\r\\n\\r\\nFirstly, Robert Pattinson was the worst choice for the Batman role. In Twilight he was alright, but in Batman he definitely failed. He was more like a sad, depressed goth kid with no emotions. He tried too much to fit the role, but in fact we got this depressive, dead and empty Batman. \\r\\n\\r\\nSecondly, there were other small things that sucked about this movie, for example, Cat Woman had a very simple and stupid mask. Even older movie versions had a better mask than here. Batman's batmobile also sucked. Looked like a downgraded version. He also rode just a simple bike and lastly, he couldn't even glide with his default Batman suit. Also, don't know why but James Gordon was played by a black actor, while in every movie and even in every game this character is white. Riddler character also seemed stupid, wearing stupid mask and acting stupid and wasn't intimidating at all, but laughable. So, in general cast and acting was disappointing in this movie.\\r\\n\\r\\nLastly, the movie itself... It was dull, boring and depressive. They tried to make it masterpiece with 3 hours long, but in reality movie became just plain boring and I almost fell asleep. \\r\\n\\r\\nOverall verdict: Disappointing.\",\n",

       "     'content': 'Never saw the first one, nor played any of the games - but I still quite enjoyed this animated adventure. \"Sonic\" is determined to use his powers to be a crime fighting hero, but frequently causes more havoc than the criminals! When the dastardly \"Robotnik\" manages to escape from his prison in a galaxy far, far, way and returns with the echidna from hell (\"Knuckles\") though, our blue pal finds himself and his family in considerable peril. Luckily, help is on hand from the twin-tailed \"Tails\" and battle lines are drawn Who can find the giant emerald first? The story is pretty derivative - bits of \"Indiana Jones\"; \"National Treasure\" and even \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" all seem to have influenced the story, which I have to say is a little predictably thin. That said, it is well placed with plenty in the script for the grown ups amongst the audience. \"Sonic\" makes for quite a likeable rodent and Jim Carrey\"s engagingly hammy, moustachioed, megalomanic works well. The star? Well that\\'s Natasha Rothwell\\'s no-nonsense, would-be bride \"Rachel\" (a part of the storyline that doesn\\'t work so well, but she is definitely not to be messed with). The visual effects are impressive and though maybe fifteen minutes too long, I still found it very much better than I had expected.',\n",

Doctor Robotnik (Jim Carrey) was banished from Earth by Sonic (Ben Schwartz) and crash-landed his spaceship on the Mushroom Planet. His only means of escape is Sonic’s quill, which is flowing with immense energy, and he uses it to send out a distress signal. This catches the attention of Knuckles (Idris Elba), another super-powerful anthropomorphic animal like Sonic. Knuckles is the last living member of the echidna tribe that was wiped out in the same war that sent Sonic to Earth many years ago.',\n",

       "     'content': 'The third time is the charm or, after having been less than thrilled about the last two movies I have watched this one was finally one that I quite enjoyed.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I watched the first Sonic movie with the kids I was quite amused by it. This one I also watched with the kids and I have to say it was some fun two hours.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese movies are pure comedies with an aspect of adventure. Make no mistake about, they are silly movies. Then, with Jim Carrey in one of the lead roles that is what anyone that has not lived under a rock in Coyote land would expect.\\r\\n\\r\\nJim Carrey more often than not grates on me with his overacting and ridiculous behavior but in this movie he is the perfect fit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe movie sets the tone right away when it starts at the mushroom planet, or as Jim Carrey (Dr Robotnik) calls it, the piece of shitake planet, with Dr Robotnik’s coffee making machinery.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat follows is one long ride of, mostly, slapstick jokes but still following the red thread of the story. A story which is not really bad and which adds a nice adventure aspect to the movie.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe movie even adds some realism, although they probably did not realize that during production, in that the federal agents are just as big a–holes as they have proven themselves to be in real life lately.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe grand finale with Dr Robotnik’s huge robot was quite hilarious. I really do not want to spoil things but watch out for that moustache. I’m happy that they refrained from following up that snot laser with a fart laser though.\\r\\n\\r\\nBottom line, a really fun family adventure movie.',\n",

This time the movie swaps Sonic's human sidekicks for animated characters from the games, with Idris Elba's Knuckles being surprisingly funny (I didn't expect that from the trailers). Just like the first movie, Carrey makes this movie so entertaining. His outrageous performance perfectly fits the role of a kids' video game villain, and his snappy dialogue and quipped one-liners made me laugh at almost every scene he graced. Sonic 2 is not a typical movie I would choose for myself, but I'm not upset when my little daughter chooses to watch it over many other kids' movie options.\",\n",

       "     'content': '_Hotel Transylvania: Transformania_ had a lot of obstacles relating to its release and after viewing the film you can understand why. It’s a lukewarm sendoff that mostly feels like a lethargic attempt to recapture its former glory. It’s built around an entertaining concept that it doesn’t fully capitalize on.

They arrive and settle down to make their porn film. Director \"RJ\" (Owen Campbell) isn\\'t happy when his girlfriend \"Lorraine\" (Jenna Ortega) wants to join in and determines to skedaddle in the middle of the night. Suffice to say, he doesn\\'t quite manage and next thing the whole load of them are in peril of their lives. This contains one of the daftest old age sex scenes I have ever seen, but that is all I found even vaguely memorable about this rather derivative film. Sure, it\\'s got an hungry alligator but the ending is weak, and the characters just parodied everything crass from the tacky late 1970s adult entertainment industry in a really flat, sterile, fashion. Takes too long to get going, and certainly does not need to be seen on a big screen. More V than X, I\\'d say.',\n",

So many movies are either plagued with remakes or supernatural elements, it is so nice to see a back to bones hack and slash. This movie does way more than that though, deep down there is a very heart touching story about growing old and becoming irrelevant. It is so interesting to be so emotionally connected to the killer but yet disturbed by the actions they take as well. I just cannot get over how good this movie is! The gore, the setup, the dialogue, the plot, everything about it I dug.

       "     'content': '**By: Louisa Moore / www.ScreenZealots.com**\\r\\n\\r\\nTi West is a great visual director, and you can count on his films looking polished and amazing. Such is the case with “X,” the first film in his series of slashers (including the prequel, “Pearl,” and the upcoming “MaXXXine,” which is currently in development). While “X” was released first, I would still recommend watching “Pearl” beforehand. Either order is fine, but I think screening the prequel and keeping the actual story timeline in order makes the most sense if you’re just starting out. “X” features grindhouse style horror that offers an homage to 1970s classics like “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre” but the film also lends a unique, fresh spin on the genre.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe year is 1979, and aspiring adult film actress Maxine Minx (Mia Goth) is joined by her cast and crew (Brittany Snow, Kid Cudi, Jenna Ortega, Owen Campbell, and Martin Henderson) to make a different kind of pornographic picture. The group ventures to a remote farmhouse in rural Texas to shoot their film, but something feels “off” about the elderly property owners Howard and Pearl (Stephen Ure and Goth, in a dual role). Their reclusive hosts are unaware of what’s going on out back until they catch the performers in the act. This sets off a chain of very violent events that has everyone fighting for their lives.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe retro horror setting serves the story well, even if it has the most basic of plots. What makes this script (penned by West) stand out is the dry humor and interesting, well-written characters that have a lot of depth. It doesn’t take long to start to like and care for these people, which makes their inevitable demise hit a little harder. West’s script includes themes of aging, ambition, voyeurism, and jealousy, all tied together with the joy of setting yourself free from repression. Stifled desire causes the elderly couple to begin their killing spree, but there is so much more underneath the carnage.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film features explicit bloody violence, gore, nudity, and sex, earning its hard “R” rating. West doesn’t turn his camera from the bloodshed even when the audience instinctively looks away. If you aren’t accustomed to horror, this film may not be for you.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cast is comprised of terrific indie actors who trust their director onscreen and off, which shows in their work. Being able to feel so free in front of the camera makes it an easier task to also stand behind it, and all of this results in great entertainment for the audience. The movie is fun and smart, if uncomplicated.\\r\\n\\r\\n“X” ends with a wholly satisfying finale and avoids the pitfalls of frustrating the audience, as so many independent horror films seem to do. It’s a slower burn for sure, but what a rewarding ride.',\n",

       "     'content': 'The digital animation geniuses at Pixar are back with “Turning Red” and it marks a departure for the studio known for the “Toy Story” and “Cars”, franchises.\\r\\n\\r\\nSet in 1990s Toronto, the film centers around 8th grader Mei (Rosalie Chiang), who considers herself an adult at 13 and eagerly applies herself to school when she is not helping her family tour business at a local Temple or hanging with her friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nLife comes crashing to a halt when after a traumatic day of embarrassment; Mei awakens in the form of a large Red Panda. In a panic, Mei attempts to hide her situation which causes her over-protective mother to assume it is Puberty related and that her hormones are kicking in.\\r\\n\\r\\nMei desperately wants to get her life back to normal and learns that as long as she is calm her Panda is under control. However, this proves to be harder than expected and soon Mei learns that the Panda is the result of a family bloodline but there is a way to end it during a Lunar ceremony in a couple of weeks.\\r\\n\\r\\nChaos soon follows as Mei struggles with her situation and must find a way to cope with the changes that are going on and make some very important decisions about her life and her future.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film is a difficult one to review for me as never having been a teenage girl dealing with puberty, raging estrogen, and the issues that go with it.  That being said the film struggles to find a balance as it tacks on the capers of Mei in Panda form without being overly funny or charming and keeps the focus on Teen Angst, puberty-related issues and becoming an adult.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film lacks the interesting characters, charm, and appeal that have set the foundation for so many Pixar films and it is surprising that a company that can elicit a range of emotions in an animated short fail to really connect with their latest feature. There were some amusing parts but the film as a whole was rather dull and lacked much in the way of humor and was very predictable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe decision to put the film directly on Disney+ as the studio’s recent “Soul” and “Luca” was raised some controversy but in the end, I do believe it was the right decision as “Turning Red” is not likely to be a film that draws people to the cinema beyond the opening weekend.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a film that is a bold step for the company, but one that lacks the charm and humor of previous films as not everyone is going to want to sit through a feature-length film on teenage angst and dealing with changing bodies and the emotional turmoil that follows.  However, the target audience is likely to connect with the characters and it will be interesting to see what the reaction to the film is long-term.\\r\\n\\r\\n3 stars out of 5\\r\\n\\r\\n“Turning Red” will debut on Disney+ on March 11th',\n",

It soon turns out that these transformation skills run in the family, and huge great angry pandas are not to be messed with. The animation is fine and Eilish/O\\'Connell have written some fitting, if hardly their most memorable, numbers, but it is just too long and the theme recycles itself once too often for my old eyes.

       "     'content': \"**Pixar discovered anime and is looking to conquer the eastern box office.**\\r\\n\\r\\nI had some expectations regarding this film. I don't know exactly what I expected, but I think everyone will understand if I say that the film is signed by Disney and Pixar, two studios with an enviable track record of successes. However, as soon as the film ended, I felt that I wasn't exactly the target audience for this film: male, over thirty, European, with little connection with pop culture or the anime world.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film follows a young teenager, daughter of Chinese parents, in a somewhat cathartic experience in which she transforms into a friendly red panda. The film focuses on this transformation and turns it into a metaphor for a transformation called puberty, a discovery of one's own individuality and autonomy, particularly with regard to the relationship with one's parents.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film is good, but the theme is… complicated. If it is absolutely true that most teenage girls will see themselves in some of the adventures that Mei experiences, it is no less true that many parents and guardians will face the topic with discomfort and raise some objections regarding a certain “apology of rebellion” that the film suggests. On a positive note, it was the first time I saw an animated film aimed at young audiences that addressed menstruation bluntly. The dialogues continue to insist, however, on that stereotype of the panicking teenager and the mother disturbed by the moment and insisting that, now, her daughter is a woman. This is stupid and conveys inaccurate ideas: a woman is a woman from before birth, from a biological point of view, and becomes a woman from a psychological and social point of view long after her first menstruation, when she begins to be old enough and mature enough to make their own decisions (the same applies to men, with the necessary reservations). In addition to these problems, the plot seems a little incipient to me, following paths that are quite obvious, opting for predictable solutions and creating basic characters. I could even talk about the amount of stereotypes about Chinese and Orientals present in this film… but do I need to talk about that?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe best thing about the film is the animations and the extraordinary quality of the drawings and effects. Pixar does not miss the opportunity to defend its credits and reputation in digital animation and offers us a feast for the eyes, with a realism and attention to detail that is difficult to overcome and that makes us think about the way technology has evolved in just a few years: “Toy Story” isn’t even thirty years old yet, and it already seems a little dated! Just one problem: I'm not a fan of anime at all. I think it's a very stylized, excessive, exaggerated type of animation. Unfortunately, this film adopts too many elements that are imported from the anime. Look at the eyes, the exaggeratedly large mouths, the sudden changes in the characters' poses or attitudes... you can't have one foot in two worlds at the same time.\",\n",

There were jokes here and there, but nothing major to distract me at all.

It's science fiction film that captivates your imagination. The plot and ideas I found very interesting. I enjoyed the movie, so I would recommend to catch it in the cinemas.

       "     'content': 'Is this a good movie? Well, if you expect some reasonable scientific accuracy or a story that is logical then hell no! If however you only seek two hours of entertaining action-adventure and a shitload of special effects, then it is a pretty good movie.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story behind this movie is ludicrous to say the least. There are so many holes in it, so much scientific bullshit and so much illogical behaviour by everyone involved that this would be a very, very long post should I list them all.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the way, the rest of this review might contain a spoiler or two if you have not yet seen the movie.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven if we ignore the absolutely nonsensical notion that you could actually cram a white dwarf star into the moon without it affecting Earth, like tearing it apart, the story is ludicrous to say the least.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would say that the notion that NASA, after the space shuttle clearly being hit by a foreign object would not only decide to hide behind some bullshit human error excuse but also get away with it is rubbish. But then, after two years with a senile sock puppet claiming to be the president of the United States and seeing how one lie after another, each one more obvious and ludicrous than the next, have been spewed out as well as bolstered by a completely biased, borderline criminal, mainstream media and tech industry, maybe it is not that far fetched.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen we of course have the usual Hollywood “features” like a main character that starts off by being a reckless and utterly stupid moron, people just standing there and staring, and doing nothing, at bad things approaching and so on and so forth.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, if you put your brain in idle, something that you have to do more often than not when it comes to Hollywood movies today, this is actually a quite entertaining movie. At least as far as I am concerned.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, it is predictable as hell but it is still a good action-adventure and the nonsensical story behind it allows for some unusual and spectacular special effects. The special effects are of course making up for most of the stars I was willing to give this movie. It is more or less the reason to watch it.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne good thing about the movie though, is that it is refreshingly void of woke and political bullshit preaching. No green propaganda or gender or race crap. Well unless you count the US military being portrayed as the usual morons that they are in Hollywood movies of course. Seriously? Even if you managed to fire Earth’s entire nuclear arsenal into the moon it would have zero effect. But then again, with woke asshats like General Milley you never know.\\r\\n\\r\\nBottom line, despite the absence of science a ludicrous story, to me, this was a quite entertaining (science) fiction movie with plenty of special effects and action.',\n",

Michelle Yeoh leads the troops in a film that also pays homage to the iconic career of the actress who, at 59 years old, accompanies the fantastic stunt team in truly outlandish fights.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mother-daughter relationship as the emotional core of the story follows a surprisingly predictable path and needs a few more dialogues to deliver an even more powerful climax, but it still induces tears and a genuine sense of concern for the characters.\\r\\n\\r\\nTechnically, all the elements are so creatively unique that it warrants the clickbait \"you\\'ve never seen anything like this\".\\r\\n\\r\\nSee it in theaters!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRating: A',\n",

       "     'content': 'I loved both Michelle Yeoh (\"Evelyn\") and Jamie Lee Curtis (\"Deirdre\") in this entertainingly surreal take on the latest multi-verse theme to hit the cinemas. The former is a lady trying to balance the books at her failing laundry who must face the wrath of the latter - an imposing IRS investigator. Add to her woes, she has her hapless husband \"Waymond\" (Ke Huy Quan); her recently out lesbian daughter \"Joy\" (Stephanie Hsu) and her imperious and disapproving father \"Gong Gong\" (James Hong). Frankly, this poor woman does not have her troubles to seek. Then, all of a sudden, there is a rift - and in best Lewis Carroll tradition, \"Evelyn\" finds herself in not just one, but in multiple realities where she has everything from superpowers to a need to save the world from beings that would permanently unravel all the layers of existence on planet Earth. It\\'s frankly impossible to adequately evaluate the plot - it lurches, veers, wobbles and meanders all over the shop with precious little linear to guide the viewer. It is a tour de force from Yeoh, well directed and scripted - frequently amusingly - that asks just as many questions as it strenuously attempts to avoid answering. It is aptly titled - and you need to have your eyes (and your brain) on wide beam to get the most from this feast of ostensibly nonsensical, but often poignant, series of escapades that search for what could constitute any degree of life-satisfaction for \"Evelyn\". A second viewing is highly recommended - it has plenty more to give once you\\'ve calibrated your senses after the first time, and big screen shows off some great VFX that do not impose themselves on this character-driven movie.',\n",

The cinematography is surprisingly coherent given the almost manic visual quality the story demands, and it manages consistently to look great.

       "     'content': 'Everything Everywhere All at Once had lofty expectations to fill, and unfortunately it fails to deliver the five-star rating I was expecting going into the film.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is nothing inherently wrong with the movie in general, there was a surface level plot with complex themes at play, which somehow balances the zany world of the multiverse with an intimate connection between mother and daughter. This connection had a nice arch throughout the story but failed to draw me in emotionally. I understood what I should feel in those impactful moments but had a hard time connecting.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe performances were great. Ke Huy Quan was incredible and one of the highlights of the entire movie. His switch from clueless doppy husband to multi-versal warrior had me hysterically laughing. Michelle Yeoh is fantastic and deserving of all her praise and award buzz.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite my problems with a lack of connection to the story, the action really raises this movie as a whole. There is something so captivating about 60-year-old women performing incredible complex kung fu against one another. The brutality is superb and incredibly fun to watch. Another layer to the action is the actions our characters must perform to tape into their multi-versal selves. These are crazy, vulgar, and some of the most shocking things I have seen on screen.\\r\\n\\r\\nScore: 85% |\\r\\nVerdict: Great',\n",

This movie should be called the multiverse of madness. The things that were written in \"Doctor Strange 2\" I saw in this movie in terms of the worlds, the characters, and the strange things that happen.\\r\\n\\r\\nCritics expressed their admiration for this film and it won the admiration of many, but from my point of view, yes, it was enjoyable, but the duration of the movie was unpleasant and long for me. There is a good message in the movie, which is an atmosphere that contains a rush about oneself and how important we are in this universe, at the same time you discover that you aren\\'t important in this universe.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a strong emotional factor in the movie, which is the story of a mother with her daughter and the love of the family, but the film sometimes took unexpected comedic paths and was affected by the emotional factor. At the same time, there are things that are supposed to be funny and they actually made many viewers of the film laugh, but at the same time you see Some of the comedy scenes were disgusting and nauseating.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe movie is special and it is one of the best good movies you will see in 2022, but at the same time the movie needed a better balance in terms of comedy and drama in a way that summarizes this is similar to the movie The Matrix, which is a person who can enter another world through his mind. Here you see the idea is similar, but in multiple universes, and you see these multiple universes and you see the options.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis movie makes you think about your personal decisions and makes you think that there are people like you, but in other universes they made decisions that affected you. Here this idea is creative, but what bothered me was the comedic situations at the wrong time. There are emotional scenes that were touching. Great dialogue scenes, but they were damaged by the comedy because sometimes the movie Reminds me of Marvel movies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cinematography, editing, and music were wonderful, which was an essential factor in the film\\'s story. The scene of the rocks was eye-catching, wonderful, deep and poignant, but at the same time the director decided to show this story and how he used somewhat disgusting comedic tools. It was something for me that was inappropriate and inappropriate.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, I know that this movie has Hollywood agendas, and this is a large part that contributed to it receiving very high and fabulous ratings, but in general, there are things I liked in the movie and things I didn\\'t like.',\n",

       "     'content': \"Thematically, this movie has something to chew on.  Unfortunately the metaphor used to explore the theme is constructed in a sloppy way that falls apart under any scrutiny.  Well performed actions sequences are irrelevant to the progression of the theme and only serve to mark time between the tidbits of character drama spread out over the movie.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe superficial plot and setting similarities to The Matrix also bring these shortcomings into sharp focus.  Whereas the former takes pains to communicate it's ideas to the audience with precise foreshadowing, EEAAO tries to throw as many ideas at you as fast as possible hoping that you won't notice they have no substance, and ultimately don't matter.  The former has action scenes that are relevant to the theme, progress the story, and matter to the character's journey.  The later simply has me waiting until they're over for the story to pick back up.  It's not that there's nothing this movie has to say, it's simply afraid to say it without constant 'lol so random!!' memes.\",\n",

Despite misgivings and unresolved feelings; Nathan joins with Victor and finds himself in a daring caper to steal a valuable object that could unlock the key to a gold supply that has been lost for over five hundred years.\\r\\n\\r\\nNaturally, there are others who want the money, and Nathan, Victory, and their dubious partner Chloe (Sophia Ali); as they rush around the world in one adventure after another to solve the ancient puzzles and stay one step ahead of some very deadly individuals.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe movie has elements of “National Treasure” and “Raiders of the Lost Ark” in terms of the quests to find ancient treasures mixed with action but keeps things in a simpler context. The focus is not on plot development, character development, or plausibility but considering the film is based on a video game, it does a good job with the source material.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere has been some controversy about the casting of Holland as Nathan is older in the game series, but he goes all-in with his performance even when the acrobatic action sequences does offer many reminders of his Spider-man role.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe action in the game is fun and over-the-top and more than once I thought I should be pushing my X and Square button to help him make the moves necessary to complete the task and survive.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe post-credit scenes offer some great possibilities for future adventures and those would be more than welcome for those looking for some no-brainer escapist entertainment.\\r\\n\\r\\n3.5 stars out of 5.',\n",

       "     'content': 'I\\'m just an ordinary joe.  I\\'ve never played the game this movie is adapted from but from what I hear it\\'s pretty fun.  The movie itself is okay for a treasure hunting movie.  The action is good and keeps flowing, and the actors, Holland (latest Spiderman) and Whalberg seem to have good chemistry.  Even the female protagonist did well in her \"diverse & inclusive\" part.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIf I had any cons to put forth about the movie, I\\'d say the lead villian being a female (thanks to Woke-Hollywood\\'s influence) has been thoroughly worn to the point of irritation.  This woke trope is tired and worse, but oh-so-true to the core, it is dubious at best; especially so when it comes to fight scenes between the protagonist and villain.  It is time for Hollywood to hang up its Woke-cape.  There is no need for \"inclusivity\" when you can just give someone the job because it works for the story instead of politics.  I wouldn\\'t complain on this aspect so much if Liberal (woke) Hollywood had the ability to write good characters and therefore good scripts.  But that is not possible when you are reaching to tick off checkboxes.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Somewhat Spoiler & complaints:** If the movie had simply begun with a female villain and had her demostrate certain abilities in combat, then her fighting men would be more believable.  It also would establish WHY her people would follow her.  But the female antagonist\\'s action scenes do not come across as pertinent as they should because her profession is not established in the movie.  I struggled to get a handle on whether she was a fellow treasure hunter since she knew Walberg\\'s character personally and was there to advise the rich villain, or if she was a hired mecenary.  Turns out she was the later, but that still did not help  her character gel.  I kept thinking, \"Why on earth would anyone follow her?  She\\'s hasn\\'t done anything to prove she\\'s more than any other run-of-the-mill killer.\"  If the movie failed in any way it was this one glaring aspect.  Henry Cavill made an EXCELLENT head henchman in Mission Impossible: Fallout, because men fighting men is believable; villains have menace.  But without that special training I mentioned for a female villian, any interaction between her and men in fight scenes comes across as purely contrived.  The actress, Tati Gabrielle, did very well as a villain but this women fighting men is just not believable; and that matters to the male viewing audience.  Instead of sitting on the edge of your chair wondering who\\'s going to win, you\\'re sitting back with a finger to your temple wondering what bullcrap Hollywood is going to make of this fight scene.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIf I have to rate this movie on a whole I give it 3.5/5 stars.  It\\'s far removed from _National Treasure_ or _Indiana Jones_, but it\\'s better than _Red Notice_, if only just.',\n",

       "     'content': 'This movie was pretty much what I expected or rather hoped for. It was a fun adventure/action rollercoaster plain and simple. This is one of those, rare nowadays, movies that are meant to entertain plain and simple. Two hours of adventure, action and twists barely held together by a rudimentary story and no woke rubbish or bullshit preaching. The latter is probably what rendered it a 40% rotten “critics” score on woke tomatoes while the audience gave it a 90% fresh score. As almost always a rotten score on woke tomatoes is an indication that it is a movie worthwhile watching.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story, as can be seen from the movie blurb, is a treasure hunt a la Indiana Jones. It starts off by introducing the main character, Nathan, in a few brief scenes where Nathan bungles up a heist being perpetrated by his brother after which they are involuntarily separated.\\r\\n\\r\\nQuick forward to present time and the main story takes off with Nathan being persuaded by Sullivan to embark on a hunt for an immeasurable treasure. Not exactly the newest or freshest of stories but if it works don’t fix it.\\r\\n\\r\\nPretty much everyone in this movie is a self-centered scoundrel with little to no care for anyone except themselves. Thus the action and treasure hunting is regularly interrupted by twists and betrayals. No one will claim that this movie has an elaborate and intelligent story. It does not have to. It is just meant to hold the action together.\\r\\n\\r\\nI quite liked the main actors. Sullivan did a good job of being the blasé, self-centered scoundrel, Nathan of being the somewhat naive wannabe treasure hunter and Braddock was quite cool, and sexy (hey, I’m a guy), as the baddie. Antonio Banderas was Antonio Banderas although I was saddened by his premature exit from the hunt.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall the action was nice although the scenes in, and out of, the airplane was the usual unrealistic Hollywood action. Although that was overshadowed with the ship carrying helicopter scenes towards the end which was taking unrealism to new levels. But I didn’t really care because it was fun silliness. The moment they started to carry those ships away I started to hope that the writer would go for the silly and obvious stunt involving black powder. Yes unrealistic but there is no denying the coolness factor.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs far as I am concerned this was two hours well spent. The ending scene clearly suggested that the producers hoped to make a sequel. I would definitely watch it but with all the people lamenting the fact that someone dared to make a movie simply for entertainment without a profound (and boring) story or bullshit preaching in it that might not happen. It did make about four times its budget at the box office though so maybe.',\n",

       "     'content': \"_Uncharted_ was perfectly predictable. I had a general idea of what to expect going into the film and got most of everything I wanted. While it is not groundbreaking cinema, it does offer so very great action set pieces that are pulled straight from the games I grew up loving. The story is very reminiscent of an adventure Nathan Drake would take during the games and the environments were diverse and engaging. My one big critique is the performances. While they were fine, I did not really think the casting was done in terms of the characters themselves but more for the star power. Tom Holland plays a character that is an edgier Peter Parker, he still has the charisma of Nathan Drake but there is something about him that still feels naïve and less sure of himself. I understand this is early in Nathan Drake's career, but it still felt to overly Spider-Man for me. There is really not much to say for Mark Wahlberg either, he plays pretty much the same character as every one of his other films. Sophia Ali, Tati Gabrielle, and Antonio Banderas all do a fine enough job in their roles but never do anything that make their performances stand out. Overall, this movie is fun if you sit back, relax and enjoy some great action and exploration. It is not great, but it definitely passes the time and is good time.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Score**: _68%_ | **Verdict:** _Good_\",\n",

Several sequences and setpieces were lifted directly from the games, which is a fabulous treat for fans of the series, but that is about where the similarities end. Although a fantastic actor, Holland was a younger choice than many expected for the role, making Uncharted Nathan Drake\\'s origin story. Unfortunately, this was less origin and more Mary Sue, as Drake already had all the knowledge and skills to navigate this outrageous movie. The CGI was obvious, and the stunts and action were so unbelievable for a character that started the movie as a bartender that it made it difficult to enjoy. All the characters were so unlikeable and duplicitous, with almost every interaction ending in another \"surprising\" betrayal. Mark Wahlberg\\'s performance didn\\'t fit in the movie either. He felt like he was just playing himself with goofy quips and fast-talking rather than trying to play a character in this universe. I was hoping for so much more, but this franchise-launching film was dead on arrival.',\n",

       "     'content': \"I really enjoyed the movie. It's funny, the action scenes are very well done, the characters are charming, the dialogues are excellent and the animation style, in a mix of 2D and 3D, is the icing on the cake to complete an (almost) perfect animation.\\r\\n\\r\\n'Almost' because the plot was pretty average. It's interesting and even brings a nice message, but I think it lacked a little more development, especially in making the movie more unpredictable. Halfway through the movie you already knew who the villain was and how the movie was going to end. They even added multiple 'twists' to make the story more unpredictable, but almost all of them were far-fetched and failed to surprise me.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite that, this movie was a breath of originality from Dreamworks after a decade of bland animations. I'll give it a solid 8.\",\n",

       "     'content': 'It is hard to believe it has been 25 years since “Scream” premiered and in doing so; brought new life into the slasher genre which had become stale due to an abundance of direct to DVD and cable releases combined with many uninspired and stale theatrical releases.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe movie was a massive success and launched a very successful trilogy and made the Ghostface killer and many moments from the series Pop Culture mainstays.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a hiatus; “Scream 4” arrived and continued the series and in 2022; “Scream” has arrived which continues the story to the eager anticipation of fans.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen a young girl named Tara (Jenna Ortega); is brutally attacked in a fashion very similar to the Ghostface Killer; her sister Sam (Melissa Barrera); returns to Woodsboro to be by her side while Tara recuperates.\\r\\n\\r\\nSam is joined by her boyfriend Richie (Jack Quaid), who has no idea about the history of Woodsboro nor the popular “Stab” film series that is based on the events of the murders that have plagued the town.\\r\\n\\r\\nSam’s past troubles makes her return difficult and when Ghostface strikes again; she and Richie seek the help of Dewey (David Arquette); who has fallen on hard times and has split from Gayle (Courtney Cox). Despite his reluctance; Dewey gets involved and tells Sam the “rules” which would indicate the killer might be someone she knows and soon everyone in her and Tara’s circle becomes suspect even as the deaths start to increase.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis allows for some of the best moments of the film as the characters make references to several other modern and past horror franchises and discuss things from online Trolls, rabid fans, and other Pop Culture references which provides some tongue in cheek humor about the series and also establishes the world of “Scream” as one where people are well-versed in horror films old and new and have modified the rules based on sequel, prequel, and “Requel” rules for films.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs tensions and body count mounts; Gayle, Dewey, and Sidney (Neve Campbell) must face their fears to stop Ghostface before it is too late.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the final act of the film is very over the top and at times absurd; it does provide plenty of the elements that fans have come to expect from the series. I was able to accurately see and predict almost all of the twists very early in the film and did not have many surprises as the film unfolded; I think many will still find enough enjoyment watching the tale unfold as after four films I have a pretty good idea of the formula for the series and also have many years of this as I saw the twists in “The Sixth Sense” and “The Village” very early in the films so I just seem to have a knack for this sort of thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile it does not break much in the way of new ground; the film does deliver what fans have come to expect and I did find in more enjoyable than “Scream 3” and there was more than enough to keep me entertained. There have been rumors that a sixth film has already been planned and if so: I will be more than ready for more.\\r\\n\\r\\n3.5 out of 5',\n",

I’ll see and support any new _Scream_ film or TV series that comes along because of it. I know this new installment was successful ($88.4 million worldwide box office gross as of this writing) and some enjoyed it, but it is honestly my least favorite in the franchise.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis new film feels like it’s trying too hard to be one of the original _Scream_ films when it should have just been more of its own thing.

It reinvented horror and launched a franchise of sequels of varying quality. And this newest one is the best since the first! It captured all the fun of the first. It kept the stakes high by bringing back the original cast and proving that no one is truly safe. The directors had fun baiting the audience with every slasher trope they could. Tense music would rise every time a character walked past a dark doorway or opened a cabinet to hide the view from the hall - naturally, that is when the killer is standing on the other side but not in Scream! Playing with the tropes in a fun, self-aware way is what Scream is all about, and Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett nailed it.',\n",

This movie is slasher history repeating itself in more ways than one; in addition to revisiting this particular franchise, it borrows a key plot point from Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare – that I will not reveal but which you may have inkling about if you are, like me, a student of the genre.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll of the above notwithstanding, Scream ‘22 is overall more good than bad. True to its roots, this iteration serves as a deconstruction of the current state of mainstream horror cinema. Specifically, it is a textbook example of a “requel” – like the last couple of Halloweens, or the recent Texas Chainsaw Massacre –, and by ‘textbook’ I mean that it actually includes a scene where a character literally explains what a requel is and how it works. I also like that it lampshades one of my least favorite tropes, which I call Chekhov's Inhaler.\\r\\n\\r\\nI just compared it to Halloween and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but the fact is that Scream ‘22 comes to join the much better company of Wes Craven’s New Nightmare and last year’s Candyman (suitably, the movie is dedicated to Craven’s memory and gives Jordan Peele a shoutout). This Scream’s oft-repeated mantra is “always go back to the original,” and that’s sage advice because, like Nightmare on Elm Street, this franchise is a brainchild of Craven that began life as thinking man’s horror only to get progressively dumbed down with each new entry – unlike, say, Friday the 13th, which was born stupid.\\r\\n\\r\\nThankfully, this film has been made by people with knowledge of and respect for their source material, and who don’t underestimate the audience’s intelligence. Consequently, when characters send text messages, the words appear on their phone screens as opposed to our movie and TV screens, and when a someone is stabbed, they spill real fake blood instead of a stream of red pixels (and in an age where CGI is the norm, any horror movie that uses practical effects instantly doubles its visceral impact). I will only add that, also like New Nightmare and Candyman ‘21, Scream ‘22 is as much of a return to form as it is a fitting farewell, so here’s hoping that it will live up to its promise that “After tonight, no more books, no more movies, no more f***ing Ghostface.”\",\n",

       "     'content': 'Originally set to release in December of 2019; the long-delayed cinematic retelling of Agatha Christie’s “Death on the Nile” has finally arrived in cinemas. The last cinematic version of the classic book arrived in 1978 and this time; Director and star Kenneth Branagh beings his version of Master Detective Hercule Poirot to Egypt after a chance encounter with his friend Bouc (Tom Bateman) while on vacation; Poirot attends the wedding of wealthy socialite Linette Ridgeway (Gal Gadot) and notices that she has married a man named Simon Doyle (Armie Hammer).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wedding is a bit of a shock to many as just six weeks prior Doyle was engaged to Jacqueline de Bellefort (Emma Mackey), and Poirot observed the two of them in a London club and how Ridgeway was introduced to Simon by her friend Jacqueline.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wedding reception is disrupted by the arrival of Jacqueline and Linette and Simon confides in Poirot that she has been following them around the world and asks the Detective to encourage her to leave them alone so they can get on with their life.\\r\\n\\r\\nJacqueline is highly disturbed and pleads her love for Simon and shows a gun which leads Poirot to encourage the newlyweds to abandon their overseas plans and go home. Simon and Linette press on and decide to take their wedding party on a cruise of the Nile in an attempt to get away from Jacqueline.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plan seems to be working well until Jacqueline shows up as a ticketed passenger at a stop along the way. When a near-fatal accident occurs followed by a murder; Poirot must investigate the guests to find the killer. Naturally, there is plenty of motivation to go around, and as the deaths mount; Poirot must use his genius to find the killer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe movie takes its time getting started but the CGI-enhanced scenery and the strong cast are very compelling and set the pieces in place very well. While I was able to solve the mystery about halfway into the film, some of the details around it were cleverly concealed and there were plenty of twists that had me consider other possible suspects.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome may find the film a bit slow but that is the nature of a good mystery as time is given to developing the characters and their motives which adds to the suspense of the film.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the end, the film is an engaging mystery that recalls the classic movie mysteries of old and it will be very interesting to see if audiences will embrace the film in the same way as they did with “Murder on the Orient Express” and audiences will get more Poirot adventures from Branagh in the near future.\\r\\n\\r\\n4 stars out of 5.',\n",

       "     'content': 'It\\'s probably best to start by saying that this adaptation of the Agatha Christie novel has virtually nothing at all in common with the 1978 Ustinov/Niven iteration (which I really like). Sir Kenneth Branagh starts off by giving us a little of the somewhat tragic WWI backstory to the famous Belgian detective before we are introduced to the newlywed \"Doyle\" couple Gal Gadot and Armie Hammer, his disgruntled ex girlfriend \"Jackie\" (Emma Mackey - whom I could have sworn was Margot Robbie) and an assembled cast aboard the luxury Nile paddle steamer \"Karnak\" where murder and mayhem ensue. A great deal of care has been taken with this production, and it looks great. That said, though, I found the characterisations pretty sterile; there are stars here but not (Annette Bening notwithstanding) big stars, and we get to know little of the personalities or grudges of the suspects. Tom Bateman reprises his role as \"Book\" from Sir Kenneth\\'s other, equally flawed, \"Poirot\" outing back in 2017, but that stretches coincidence just a bit too much! There is little, if any humour, and though I did initially enjoy the 1930s Blues music it started to intrude a bit as the film progressed. Patrick Doyle\\'s rather bland score reminded me of \"Kingdom of Heaven\" (2005) and though there is a fair degree of location photography, there is an equally fair degree of pretty obvious CGI too. Somehow, Sir Kenneth just isn\\'t \"Poirot\" for me. His performances are always just a little bit too theatrical - he always has to be centre stage. The whole pace of the film really does lack any accumulating sense of menace and though it is certainly better seeing it on a big screen, I was really somewhat underwhelmed.',\n",

If you liked the movie then fine but this is my personal opinions so… here we go.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust as with Murder on the Orient Express it could have been a decent mystery/crime movie if it had not pretended to be a Hercule Poirot movie but again this was a miserable attempt to make a Americanized version of Hercule Poirot.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe movie starts off with black and white scenes from World War I trying to make him out to be some war hero. There was no reason for that and it is not Hercule Poirot.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne good thing I can write about the movie is that there are some lovely scenery, especially at the beginning. Unfortunately that is about it as far as the good parts go from my point of view.\\r\\n\\r\\nApart from the good scenery the film goes overboard trying to get fancy with the camera. Like the ridiculous revolving scenes on the boat, bizarre perspectives and quite a few too dark and gloomy scenes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe worst part of the movie is that it is totally disrespectful of the Hercule Poirot that Agatha Christie created. Poirot does NOT run after criminals while shots are being fired, Poirot may scream but with dignity, not soap opera like outbursts. He was not the only one having unbecoming outbursts by the way. And do not get me started about how the movie ruined the famous end scene where Poirot traditionally exposes the criminal by having Poirot waving a gun and appearing totally dishevelled. Even the hideously large moustache is just all wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\nDeath on the Nile is a British mystery novel by one of the most famous mystery writers ever, not some pulp fiction that you can put your own spin on but Kenneth Branagh does not seem to realize this.',\n",

       "     'content': 'Death on the Nile has a prologue set in World War I, where a young Hercule Poirot is played by a digitally ‘de-aged’ Kenneth Branagh. Et tu, Kenneth? If you must do this, why not get a younger actor who looks likes Branagh? Or even one who doesn’t look like the Northern Irish writer/director/actor, so long as he looks like an actual human being; it’s safe to say that Branagh looks neither like himself nor like a member of the human race (he actually looks less grotesque after an explosion disfigures one side of his face). Again, this is only if you must do this – but then, you mustn’t do it, especially considering that this prologue exists only, and I kid you not, as an origin story for Poirot’s mustache.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn order to catch up with Branagh’s current appearance, the character then ages some 40 years in the space of about two decades, and in the interim it’s the world around him that has received a digital facelift – in particular Egypt, whose entire topography and everything in it, including flora, fauna, bodies of water, architecture, historical landmarks, etc., etc., has been computer-generated, and very crudely at that. They should have called this Death on Denial, because based on the evidence of this movie, the Nile isn’t a river in Egypt – or a river at all, nor Egypt a place that bears any resemblance to any known landscape that can be found on planet Earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for the actual plot, who cares? It\\'s impossible to believe in the existence of these characters as real persons because they\\'re all clearly actors standing in front of green screens, and the \"Death\" of the title is rendered meaningless because it takes place in a lifeless world. Even an Agatha Christie murder mystery – nay, especially an Agatha Christie murder mystery demands a plausible backdrop, and in that sense a matte painting, rear projection, miniatures, any number indeed of practical special effects would offer a much more tangible setting for this story – the next best thing, as a matter of fact, to actually shooting on location (which admittedly is not always feasible).',\n",

       "     'content': '_The Lost City_ is an action-adventure rom-com combo that has more action than comedy. While there are plenty of laughs to be had throughout the film, a large percentage of them missed the mark completely. There were scenes that had me laughing aloud and others that were a little cringe at times, so the humor levels will for sure vary per viewer. The overall plot was somewhat standard but entertaining enough as comedy plots are concerned. The beginning starts off strong and then slowly fades as the plot becomes more unbelievable. The acting is excellent, as it should be with this type of star power. Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum had spectacular comedic chemistry and bounced off each other nicely. Daniel Radcliffe’s over the top villain antics were fairly decent as well, nothing groundbreaking. Brad Pitt was a standout, and I wish we saw more of him in this film, but his scenes by far were the most memorable. Even though this movie has its ups and downs, it understands what it is, and does not take itself seriously. This translates to the audience not taking it seriously as well, which results in a fairly fun viewing experience.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Verdict:** _Decent_',\n",

The movie basically revolves around Channing Tatum’s hilarious reaction to every peril and danger. Sandra Bullock charms as always, and Daniel Radcliffe’s kooky villain entertains but the best part of the film is Brad Pitt’s over-the-top hero. His character is a gut-busting foil to Tatum’s attempts to impress Sandra Bullock. The Lost City has plenty of funny moments and laughs but feels overly familiar like I have seen it all in other movies. I enjoyed The Lost City and recommend it, but I wish it did more to feel unique than rely on Tatum’s wacky antics and Pitt’s uproarious cameo.',\n",

       "     'content': 'Romance novelist Loretta Sage (Sandra Bullock) gets kidnapped by billionaire Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). She is taken to an island where her archaeological skills are needed to find a treasure hidden in a lost tomb. Sage\\'s cover model Alan (Channing Tatum), mercenary Jack (Brad Pitt), and Sage\\'s publisher Beth (Da\\'Vine Joy Randolph) try to come to Loretta\\'s aid. This riff on \"Romancing the Stone\" and a few other Hollywood projects about writers shouldn\\'t work this well. The screenplay credit is messy, but Bullock uses her impeccable comic timing to deliver. Tatum brings more to the \"dumb guy\" role than was required, Pitt should have had more fun with his pretty boy/mercenary role, and Radcliffe doesn\\'t get lost in the shuffle. Harrison, as Sage\\'s social media ambassador, steals her scenes from the name performers. Randolph is good, but like Pitt, I wanted more from her character. The Nee brothers\\' direction is heavy on technology. The color correction and lighting are harsh, and some of the special effects aren\\'t convincing. The pacing has more fits and starts than my first used car, so when a running gag or set-piece lands, it\\'s more successful than it should have been. Alan has a great scene with Loretta after she refers to her romance fiction as shlock, and he sets her straight about disrespecting the audience who loves her stories. I wish a few hundred Hollywood types, some of whom are in this film, would watch that scene, and then watch the scene again.

       "     'content': 'I can\\'t go lower than 3 stars because ever since \"Alexander\" (2004) I\\'ve had a tiny crush on Jared Leto, and some of the trails for this made him look swarthy and hot too. To be fair, also, he is not afraid of spending a great deal of time in the make up chair, as we saw in \"House of Gucci\" (2021) and frequently see here. Sadly, though, after my appreciation of Jared\\'s eye candiness wore off, what I was left with was Luke Evans\\' \"Dracula Untold\" (2014) just without Charles Dance, and a hint of \"Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\" (from 1931). The imagery is fine, the film looks super - but so what. Marvel/Columbia should be doing that anyway. It\\'s the story. It\\'s so thin. Matt Smith is lightweight at the best of times, and together with Adria Arjona\\'s really unremarkable contribution as Leto\\'s sidekick \"Dr.Bancroft\" and some sparing interventions from the other Jared in this film (Harris) this all just lollops along as if it were just the money-no-object pilot episode of a drama series that will struggle to get a commission. I love the genre, but the words barrel, bottom and scraped came to mind pretty early on. Sadly the handsome Mr. Leto reminds me of Eric Bana - very easy on the eye but not good enough to carry a film.',\n",

The human populace of how many billion people can not sustain a single vampire? No, he makes and consumes artificial blood for ethical reasons. Who says he needs to kill or hurt people to get what he needs? Horrible premise for his actions, not believable at all. And the rest of the story is the same. Weird decision making, boring, pointless dialogue. The bad guy is suddenly bad lacking any morals because he was bullied once apparently. Vampire powers are a myriad of random things. One time he is able to fly and it is hard to determine why exactly, the movie suggests because a subway train is pushing the air in front of it. Not only is it nonsense, it also looks bad CGI wise. To end on a good note, Jared Leto is a great actor and I would love to finally see him in a good movie.',\n",

Yes, it\\'s a vampire movie, and I\\'m not sure how much originality can be squeezed out of that genre anymore.  I am totally -not- a Jared Leto fan from some of his other movies and was hesitant on that behalf to watch this film.

Of course, looking for the solution leads to the bigger story that you could probably guess by now.  I\\'m also at a point where I\\'m \"over it\" with a lot of these superhero movies, so it was refreshing to see something different out of the MCU.  If I did have any complaints, there are some unanswered questions at the end, but you know, that always leaves room for a sequel.  However, on top of that, the two end credit scenes just add more \"Huuuh?\" and probably do more damage than good.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot the best movie ever, but a far reach from the worst as well.

       "     'content': 'I have to say that I quite liked this movie. A bit surprised since it is a new Marvel movie after all. It is even free of woke bull manure which made me even more surprised.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe “scientific” part of Morbius changing his DNA, overnight no less, by means of some serum that he derived from vampire bats is of course utter nonsense but one cannot really complain too much about that since it is straight from the original comic book character.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story is really simple and not much to write home about but it works in its simplicity. After all, in this kind of movie we really do not need something fancy as long as it is not downright stupid. It only needs to be a vehicle for the action and special effects and for that purpose the story works fine.\\r\\n\\r\\nI like Morbius. He is intelligent and he doesn’t just sink down in some self pity or whining sessions when he finds out that things did not go exactly as planned. Sure, he is not happy about it but at least he does research into his condition and he actually takes the effort to learn what he can do with his new powers.\\r\\n\\r\\nI also do like the special effects and the action in general. The bad guy was rather predictable and not really very charismatic but he worked fairly okay. I think that most of the actors made a good enough job actually.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I should complain about anything it was that scene in the beginning where they claimed that vampire bats could “finish off” big animals in minutes or something. That not what vampire bats do or how they feed. It is of course utter ignorant bull manure by some idiot script writer and it was really totally unnecessary to soil the movie with such nonsense already in the first scenes. I had hoped that ignorant script writers like that died out together with the last flying rubber Piranha in the early 80’s.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnyway, I quite liked the movie. A lot of movies that I’ve watched lately have felt bloated and too long for the material. This one I actually felt was too short.',\n",

       "     'content': 'Redeeming Love looks great. It features great locations shot with great cinematography, but that’s about all director D.J. Caruso can do to entice us to keep watching. It’s terrific to see a story unfolding in a non-CGI, true-to-life setting, even if it’s Cape Town standing in for California (but then some of the greatest westerns were filmed in Europe, so there’s that), but while this movie arguably achieves the western look, it fails to conjure up any sort of western feel.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe script concerns a Hooker with a Heart of Gold known as Angel, who is so sought after that the local Madame, who calls herself Duchess, holds a daily raffle to determine which lucky slack-jawed gold miners – there is more than one winner per day – get to hold sexual congress with her. This is such a cumbersome arrangement that it actually gets in the way of the plot, so that co-writers Francine Rivers and Caruso Hand Wave it not long after they have introduced it.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo-called “dirt farmer” Michael Hosea becomes smitten with Angel, so what does he do to get near her? Does he buy all the numbers in the raffle? Does he have the raffle rigged? No and no; he simply “pays double”. That’s it. Why this hasn’t occurred to at least some of the yokels who form a daily scrum outside the brothel is anybody’s guess. Another good question is where Michael, who is not a miner, finds enough “gold dust” to gain access to Angel on three different occasions.\\r\\n\\r\\nAngel wants nothing to do with Michael owing to a deep-seated hatred and distrust of men, which is established in a series of flashbacks that are so many and so long they could make up an entire, separate movie all by themselves. They are also the reason that Redeeming Love unnecessarily breaks the 120-minute mark. But the oddest part about these flashbacks is that they show Angel escaping a life of compulsory whoredom only to enter a life of voluntary whoredom. Twice. Maybe even thrice, but that last time is once again against her will. In any case, it gets to be quite repetitive after a while.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is only after Angel gets the tar beaten out of her by the Duchess’s lackey Magowan that she relents and agrees to marry Michael – but first he has to pay off her “debt” to the Duchess, and the irony that he literally buys Angel off in order to make an honest woman out of her is lost on Michael and Caruso alike.\\r\\n\\r\\nRedeeming Love’s greatest achievement, other than its photography, is how well it masks its biblical pedigree. According to Wikipedia this is a “Christian Western” based on an homonymous novel by Rivers (unread by me, though it wouldn’t surprise if she had first published it under the pseudonym F.R. Ancine), which in turn is inspired by an obscure Old Testament book – not that you would even guess at any of this by watching the movie, and that’s actually a good thing. It may be long and boring, but at least it’s not overtly preachy.',\n",

       "     'content': 'Last Looks is a mysterious stew that experiments with flavorful ingredients throughout its two-hour duration. The film ultimately collapses under its own potential resulting in a bland and flavorless concoction. Every side character is just interesting enough to pique your interest and the film is written in a way where it seems like everyone is a suspect, but every potentially exciting aspect dissolves before it has a chance to light up the sky; like a really expensive firecracker that turns out to be a dud.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film may be worth a look for Mel Gibson’s flashy, boisterous, and drunkenly absurd performance. The mystery in Last Looks is essentially comparable to trying to discover the expiration date on a can of mystery meat that has lost its label; it may be life-threatening but is otherwise a bore to experience by others. \\r\\n\\r\\nFull review: https://hubpages.com/entertainment/Last-Looks-2022-Review-A-Bland-Overstuffed-Mystery',\n",

       "     'content': 'So here\\'s the gist. \"Will\" (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) needs $231,000 urgently, so he taps up his brother \"Danny\" (Jake Gyllenhaal) who, as luck would have it, is on that very day about to hit a bank for $32m. All he has to do is drive and his worries are a thing of the past. They manage to relieve the bank of the cash ok, but horny young police officer \"Zach\" (Jackson White) becomes a fly in their ointment when he decides to ask one of the cashiers out on a date, and gets caught up in the now much more precarious raid. He gets shot, and as the ambulance is leaving to take him to hospital the two robbers jump on board as their ticket out of the now police-strewn crime scene. Luckily, onboard the ambulance, is feisty no-nonsense paramedic \"Cam\" (Eiza González) who now has to keep the critically ill officer alive whilst her two passengers try to evade the might of the LAPD with their loot. What now ensues is just ridiculous. This sixteen tonne truck manages to evade snipers, souped-up police cars, helicopters all whilst having a critically injured man in the back. It seems to have no issues running out of gas; and must have an axle and suspension system that wouldn\\'t be out of place on a Boeing 747. Gung-go police captain \"Monroe\" (Garret Dillahunt) demonstrates adequately that the more resources you have, the cockier you become - and the less successful; and the introduction of FBI man \"Anson\" (Keir O\\'Donnell) a college pal of \"Danny\" who has to rush from a marriage guidance session with his husband to try and apprehend the fugitives just tops off this rather preposterous narrative. The production is very good; the use of drones and high speed photography does create an effective image as the ambulance continues to evade pursuit, but the dialogue is dreadful. Lots of repetitive expressions with hardly a smile to be had as the plot descends willingly into the absurd. Luckily, we get to come up for air for a moment or so thanks to Christoper Cross\\' \"Sailing\" but otherwise this is a relentless chase movie with it\\'s root firmly placed in fantasy. The ending takes 2¼ to come, and when it does it is as inevitable as it is poor. I\\'m sorry, but this is nobody\\'s finest work and being the only person at the screening I couldn\\'t help but wonder if others knew better than me - and stayed at home!',\n",

       "     'content': \"6 out of 10 for this waste of good actors. Garbage camera work, loud score, and anticlimactic ending that leaves the viewer just disappointed. Car chases and gun fights must have been directed by an action flick newbie, never even once is the cause and effect in the same frame. Looking at people shooting something off-screen and in the next scene seeing bullets hit another thing does nothing for me. Might as well read a book if I'm supposed to connect the dots myself. Similarly watching cars drive fast in close-ups or over hidden ramps is just boring. Dialogue wants to be clever so much and characters are overly colorful, not very believable on the whole. The movie is suspenseful though if nothing else and that is why my rating is relatively high.\",\n",

However, his latest, Ambulance is a 90-100 minute movie that is stretched to over two hours and got tedious pretty quickly, most notably the aerial/drone shots that did make me a tad nauseous. The writing also was pretty poor including the cringe \"comedic\" lines that didn\\'t work, not to mention a few unnecessary scenes for the supporting characters. I guess on the plus side Jake Gyllenhaal can play psychotic pretty well and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II has his moments.

Lots of special effects and a mediocre story at best.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Michael Bay movie is no different. The two stars I gave it is solely for the action and the special effects. The script is not even mediocre. It is rubbish.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think what grated on me the most is that there are two characters in the whole movie that are somewhat likable. The rest are either assholes or idiots. Mostly both.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe actions of almost everyone are just annoyingly stupid and illogical. The constant bickering and shouting is frustrating. This “criminal mastermind”, Danny Sharp, is alternating between being a psychopath and just an idiot. His idiot comment towards the end that they were not the bad guys, they were just trying to get home was so braindead it was unbelievable. The police force is not really any better.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe entire chase part is just so ridiculous most of the time and the constant shouting and arguing drags it down further. The idea of doing an operation, over the phone, during a high speed chase while taking 90 degree turns every two minutes or so is laughable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen they had all this silly work up to where the baddies were going to assault the cops with their customized vehicles and the one time I expected Michael Bay to shine and even go a bit over the top it ended up being rather meh and mediocre.\\r\\n\\r\\nNormally I do not really care that much if the script is not top notch in these kind of movies as long as it is good enough to drive the action but this script was too ludicrous and devoid of intelligence even for me.',\n",

       "     'content': 'The Cinemark near me has started to show Indian movies. Not feeling like sitting home tonight, I decided to catch this one, and luck was with me.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy image of Indian movies, I confess, was that they were mostly musicals centering around a love story involving a very beautiful young woman and a very handsome young man, with lots of elaborate, high-energy dance numbers to keep things going.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a love story here, but it\\'s not the focus of the film. There are also a few large and very impressive dance numbers, but only a few. (The men\\'s dancing, extremely athletic, astounded me.)\\r\\n\\r\\nRather, this movie focuses on the story of two young men in 1920s India who, each in his own way, are fighting against the English occupiers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe English are portrayed as inhuman monsters. Very often, they made me think of the worst atrocities committed by the Germans in France during World War II, or the most rabid racists in the American South. The first time we see the two male leads dancing, a link is indeed made between the Indians and what appear to be Black American musicians.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery time the Indians manage to take revenge on the English for their inhuman abuse of the Indians, you cheer - but at times I wondered if I would have cheered watching a parallel movie about Blacks taking revenge on white racists who had mistreated them in the American South, especially if I had been in a movie theater where, like tonight, I was the only audience member who did not belong to the oppressed population. Imagine Spike Lee, for example, able to make a movie in which he did not have to worry about selling tickets to whites as well as Blacks, and you have some idea of how anti-British colonials this movie is. It is the difference between a society in which the oppressor was a small minority of the population vs. Here, where Blacks are a minority of the American population. I don\\'t want to push this comparison too far. The movie only makes the connection in one scene. But this is very definitely a movie that focuses on the story of a brutally oppressed people seeking freedom from an inhuman oppressor, rather than just a series of dance numbers.\\r\\n\\r\\nI don\\'t speak any of the Indian languages used in the movie, but I had no problem following what was going on with the subtitles, which were almost always easy to read. I\\'m sure there were cultural references I didn\\'t catch, however, especially at the end in the final big dance number, which seemed to be presenting India as a nation of different regions and cultures all united in one.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe director and cinematographer definitely deserve praise. There was one very striking visual image after the next, especially during the battle scenes. Ram Charan, dressed as a \"native warrior\"-if that term means anything anymore-flying through flames was breathtaking.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, if you\\'ve even been curious about Indian movies, give this one a try. Yes, it\\'s three hours long, but trust me, the time goes flying by. This is truly an action movie, a mixture of visual fantasy and often very graphic realism that held my interest to the end.',\n",

       "     'content': \"My first exposure to Telugu Cinema, is when I saw my wife watching a near naked guy running in the forest, chased by a Tiger, looking so shredded that I thought my wife was appreciating the sweaty, bulbous body of a forest guy. I dismissed it immediately as another macho movie after-all, which is not my wife's favorite (its Korean movies). Until I saw a raving review of the Netflix viewer in Youtube who aren't Indians but Americans and Europeans. Now that caused me curiosity. So I decided to watch it, and then watched it again. First I can't believe the quality of CGI in most cases and the great acting of the very charismatic actors NTR and Ram Charan. With Ajay Degn and Alia Bhatt making the movie an experience of a lifetime. The movie is brimming with action, drama and great fun that I wished I watched it in bigscreen. I even eatched its Telugu version. Although the Brit-actors aren't too convincing, the entire movie is bursting with energy and drama and with it a series of suspending your belief that a movie this good can feel so short even if its 3 hours. The movie led me on a journey of watching old Rajamouli, NTR and Ram Charan movies. I have been familiar with Devgn's Drishyam (also good). I just had ti watch this several times due to so many things one can find and the beauty of friendship and relationships in the world of freedom fighters. This is 11 but I can only give it 10/10 for sanity reason.\",\n",

       "     'content': '**By: Louisa Moore / www.ScreenZealots.com**\\r\\n\\r\\n“RRR” is one of those movies where just about everyone who watches it, loves it. It’s an over-the-top historical spectacle about a violent uprising in 1920s India, offering a fictitious retelling of real events. This international blockbuster has everything: thrilling action sequences, adrenaline-charged stunts, a rousing story, and euphoric Bollywood dance scenes that are nothing short of show-stopping.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plot centers around two real-life India revolutionaries, Alluri Sitarama Raju (Ram Charan Teja) and Komaram Bheem (N.T. Rama Rao Jr.), and imagines what would have happened had the two met and become friends. In “RRR,” the men join together to fight against the British Raj and brutal colonialism in order to save the people. The trail of vengeance begins after a young girl is abducted and Bheem takes action to free her from the tyrannical regime. Raju is working for the enemy and becomes a strong adversary to Bheem’s rescue mission. Clashes and chaos ensue when the two start working together.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis movie is crazy, ridiculous, silly, excessive, and absolutely amazing. Director S.S. Rajamouli has an enviable skill and master of the craft, as he puts together some truly inventive and unforgettable sequences. Everything is executed with precision and it all works, no matter how outrageous the ideas sound (like unleashing an army of CGI animals into an unsuspecting crowd). This is a strong achievement in directing, and it’s one of the most entertaining movies I have ever seen.\\r\\n\\r\\nPart of the reason the film works so well is due to the two charismatic leads who can act, dance, sing, and do their own stunts. They’re bonafide action stars with old Hollywood charisma and charm, and their screen presence is unmatched. I could happily watch these two in anything. They’re so good together that audiences should be begging for a sequel.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s not all lighthearted fun, and Rajamouli takes his historical setting seriously. The film doesn’t gloss over brutality and violence, and there are upsetting scenes of abuse and death. Men, women, and children are put in great peril. The heroes in the movie are mostly men, and women are the ones who need to be rescued. This is a macho story and not a feminist one, but that doesn’t make much of a difference to the classic action movie vibe.\\r\\n\\r\\nEverything is dialed up to the maximum level, and every second of the movie’s 3-hour-plus run time is packed. “RRR” is a crowd-pleasing cinematic experience that’s intoxicating, exhilarating, and delivers a ton of fun. It may also inspire viewers to research India’s history and learn more about the country’s revolutionaries, which is an interesting undertaking in its own right.',\n",

       "     'content': 'This movie is one, really fun, action-packed, superhero watch. The CGI, of course, is fantastic. What I love about this movie, though, is that it\\'s not just an empty, trivial story as an excuse for CGI. Quite the contrary. The story itself is a fictionalized version of a very real, revolutionary period just before Gandhi\\'s non-violence movement took the lead.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf anyone could make any complaint at all, it would be that the British roles are caricatures. Honestly though, what do we white Americans know of how Imperial Britain treated its \"non-white subjects\"? We DO know that, in 1919, British troops fired on a crowd of unarmed protesters killing hundreds of men, women and children. So the film is steeped in real history. Perhaps, the caricatures were Rajamouli\\'s way of side-stepping the issue by allowing the viewer to accept them at the same level of unreality as the two super heroes of the film.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film itself is over the top, fun and action-packed. It even has the requisite Bollywood dance scenes! I loved the way Ram became Rama, the mythological Hindu archer, an avatar of Vishnu. I probably missed other cultural references, but I suspect that when the two superheroes cooperate, they have 4 arms - that is Shiva, the destroyer with a bow and arrow in two of the arms. The story and production design are gripping. S.S. Rajamouli does such an amazing job with the pacing that three hours seems to fly by before you can even say popcorn.',\n",

Unfortunately for him, though, she wants - well, has - more of an open marriage than he might like. Indeed, she frequently all but flaunts her usually handsome and younger lovers in front of him and their friends. When one of her coterie goes missing,\"Vic\" tells his successor \"Jonas\" (Dash Mihok) that he killed him with an hammer. True or false? Soon rumours abounds, made worse when one of her other beaux \"Charlie\" (Jacob Elordi) is found floating in the pool! Is he the culprit? Well, to be honest I didn\\'t care. Affleck is nowhere near his best with this preposterous nonsense. Ana de Arias has done some stinkers lately, and this is just the latest. Just taking her clothes off and swearing provocativly isn\\'t acting. The ending is hilariously bad and all told this is just a poor effort from a declining Adrian Lyne that is as forgettable as it is terrible.

       "     'content': \"Jealousy is such a living hell that Claude Chabrol made arguably the definitive film on the subject and literally called it L’Enfer. This is an area of human relations with which Deep Water director Adrian Lyne is very comfortable, having previously directed Fatal Attraction, Indecent Proposal, Lolita (which I find superior to Kubrick’s version), and Unfaithful (loosely based on Chabrol's La Femme Infidèle. Coincidence?). To call this a retread is somewhat of an understatement, but Lyne is wise to have chosen familiar territory for his return from a 20-year break from directing.\\r\\n\\r\\nDeep Water is likewise a good career move for Ben Affleck; it gets him back on track after he followed the great The Way Back with The Last Duel and The Tender Bar (although Deep Water would have preceded all those films had it not been for covid-related delays; funny how things work). Here is a movie that allows him to give a subtly nuanced performance, and he doesn’t disappoint, taking passive-aggressiveness and elevating it into an art form.\\r\\n\\r\\nAffleck now joins his BFF Matt Damon as actors who have shined in roles based on characters created by Patricia Highsmith (and indeed this is how one might imagine Tom Ripley’s married life to be). Ana de Armas is also quite good as Melinda, Vic’s (Affleck) wife, a thoroughly despicable bitch on wheels whose only redeeming quality is Vic’s unconditional love for her.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, he loves her with almost all his heart. I say ‘almost’ because his heart may or may not be able to pump enough blood to a certain other organ – thus it is tacitly agreed that Melinda has the freedom to find solace elsewhere, usually in the arms of intellectually challenged younger men. This arrangement is no secret among the couple’s friends because Melinda is also an alcoholic with zero self-awareness.\\r\\n\\r\\nVic dismisses the whole thing in public with a blend of dry wit, deadpan sarcasm, and self-deprecating humor (which provides some of the best dialogue in the film) that can turn ambiguously menacing at the drop of hat, especially when he finds himself alone with one of Melinda’s boytoys.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to Chabrol, Lyne puts me in mind of iconoclastic British filmmaker Peter Greenaway – and not just because Vic’s pet snails remind me of A Zed & Two Noughts. I generally find movies where characters literally get away with murder in one way or another to be immoral; the few exceptions to this rule include films like Greenaway's in which there is no conventional morality to speak of in the first place. In Deep Water, no major, plot-relevant character is innocent, and they all get what they deserve – even when, like Vic, they get what they want.\",\n",

       "     'content': \"Werewolf Castle is a medieval fantasy that strives to evoke an air of authenticity. This is a film made in the same spirit as, say, Excalibur, but on a much smaller scale — and with werewolves.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a B-movie at best, but it deserves an A for effort. The filmmakers respect the audience too much to allow even the slightest shred of cheap CGI to creep into the film.\\r\\n\\r\\nIts Haunted Forest is all the more haunting for being an actual forest (the Brecon Beacons mountain range in south Wales), and the titular castle is, or at least was long ago, the real thing. I’ll take well-preserved ruins (and the state of the structure can even be justified within the con- text of the story) over a phony-looking computer-generated palace any day.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now the damn veggies. The werewolves are clearly People in Suits, and that’s the good news; the bad news is that they all wear identical masks, eternally frozen in the same expression, as if they are always mid growl.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis must perforce confine the werewolves to the background, which has the upside of shifting the focus to the human characters — among whom I include the leader of the lycanthropes, who wisely retains his hominid appearance at all times.\\r\\n\\r\\nWerewolf Castle tells a straightforward, deceptively simple story (in 90 lean minutes). Werewolves in general symbolize the Apollonian/Dionysian dichotomy, but the filmmakers establish this duality before and beyond a literal transformation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young hero, Thorfinn (Peter Lofsgard), leaves his younger brother to the mercy of the wolves so that he can cavort with a plump wench, whom he also abandons to her fate once the monsters attack their village.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, joining the “great warrior knights” Hamelin Wiltshire (Tim Cartwright), Thomas Fairhurst (Greg Draven), Osmund Blakewood (Derek Nelson) and the awesomely named Hal Skullsplitter (Jay O'Connell), is for Thorfinn the only way to redeem himself and fulfill Hal’s words: “Where once you were a coward you can now be brave, and where once people took you for a fool, new people might recognize you as a hero.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThis movie is by no means perfect, but it has a lot more heart and brains than, say, the neverending, boring, and pointless The Green Knight.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf one is forgiving of its rudimentary werewolves, and willing to let them take the place of dragons in an Arthurian pastiche, then there is much to enjoy at Werewolf Castle.\",\n",

Sebastian Stan demonstrates his ludicrous range, while Daisy Edgar-Jones gives a breakthrough performance that may warrant a couple of awards by the end of the festival.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith an extremely engaging yet too quick first act, the viewers are immediately grabbed by the endearing love story that slowly builds up to a brutally impactful revelation, leading the movie into a rabbit hole of (in)tense, suspenseful, surprising developments.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last twenty minutes are the definition of insanity.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRating: A-',\n",

When people say that, they must either be referring to the entire film or just the third act, because the sharks really don\\'t even show up until then (this is actually a bit of a compliment).\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, the CGI sharks don\\'t look their best, especially at the end. But I\\'d guess that the VFX team didn\\'t have the required time to perfect them. And (*spoilers*), the ending with the shark killed by chomping on an anchor, feels like it was just pulled from \"The Shallows\".\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, there are actually some great (and even amazing) aspects to this film. Though the third act is where it all just kind of falls apart, the story is decent and the build up to the characters getting stranded at sea, and the tension of when their supplies and shelter get smaller in nearly every scene, is done pretty well. And the cinematography, especially in the beginning, looks absolutely gorgeous and professional.',\n",

In fact, the lead character of this movie was the worse part! Her frantic screams, frustrated outbursts, and emotional moments made the typical c-list shark movie actors look much better. It is shocking how annoying her performance was. On top of that, the green screen was very noticeable and overused, making me wonder how much water even made it into this movie. I am surprised that this director also made The Princess, which was a well-done, fun action movie. What happened to this movie, then? The Requin isn’t just a bad movie; it is bad for a bad shark movie! Don’t waste your time.',\n",

I had been very disappointed in the last couple additions to the TCM franchise, so I knew it was very likely that it would not be any different with this one. I watched the film the day it came out, and received exactly what I expected, I didn't like it. I liked it more than I expected, yes, but still not enough. The acting was lacking, the premise was stupid, and it killed off the beloved legacy character in the most insulting way possible. The only redeeming aspects of the movie are the nice-looking cinematography and the amazing gore. However, I am looking forward to seeing the next one, and I have no idea why. 3.5/5.\",\n",

       "     'content': \"The original The Texas Chainsaw Massacre actually predated the original Halloween by four years, but now it’s the former’s turn to follow in the footsteps of the latter, resulting in a case of the blind leading the blind. This new Texas Chainsaw Massacre takes its cues from the recent Halloween and Halloween Kills, going as far as dusting off the franchise’s original Final Girl – the character, that is; Marilyn Burns, the actress who played the first Sally Hardesty, died in 2014, and she certainly is in a better place now (i.e., not in this movie).\\r\\n\\r\\nGenerally speaking, though, the only thing that separates this from pretty much every slasher film ever made is that, instead of the usual Dead Teenager Movie, Massacre ‘22 may very well be the first-ever Dead Millennial Movie. Speaking of which the kills, which have the power to save even the most generic and derivative of horror sequels, are another disappointment; only the first one, involving a very creative use of the bone shard sticking out of a compound fracture, shows any ingenuity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe best thing that can be said of this uninspired effort is that it’s short (shorter still considering that about 10 of its 81 minutes are devoted to the closing credits); then again, any movie is bound to be brief that lacks a proper conclusion – and I’m not referring to the fact that when Sally, who has been hunting Leatherface down “for more than 30, 40 years”, finally has him cornered, she apparently decides, all of a sudden, that after having waited multiple decades for this moment, she might as well wait a bit longer; after all, what’s another five more minutes between old friends? This is excruciatingly stupid, but if the movie ended there it wouldn't be any more unsatisfying than the actual ending.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the worst that can be said of TCM ‘22 is that it has the gall to draw a parallel between the titular chainsaw massacre and a high school shooting (“Stonebrook High”, which sounds very uncomfortably like Stoneman Douglas High School), as if a dumb movie that deals in gratuitous violence and doesn’t even have the decency to provide a cathartic resolution could ever find a way to connect emotionally to the victims of a real-life massacre. This is low, even by exploitation cinema’s sub-standards.\",\n",

       "     'content': 'The reluctant \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" franchise gets yet another reboot/reimagining/sequel, but this time they go the Halloween/Kills/Ends route and bring back a surviving character from the original film.  Things don\\'t work out as well here as they did for the \"Halloween\" series.\\r\\n\\r\\nFour idealistic, or naive?, friends purchase a ghost town in Texas.  They plan on renovating the entire town, and turning it into a progressive haven where they can save the world.  Sisters Melody (Sarah Yarkin) and Lila (Elsie Fisher), and couple Dante (Jacob Latimore) and Ruth (Nell Hudson) have run-ins with local law enforcement and some town hangers-on, with the film makers casting aspersions immediately- the Gen Z/millenials are portrayed as wide-eyed and woke, while the Texans encountered are a bunch of drawling, gun-toting racists.  Lila was injured in a school shooting, and Melody hovers over her constantly.  The group hear the tale of Leatherface from the 1974 original film, and we learn that the final surviving girl from that film, Sally (Olwen Fouere, taking the role originated by the late Marilyn Burns), became a Texas Ranger and is currently waiting for the call that her archnemesis may still be found since the murders of her friends are officially listed as \"unsolved.\"  The group arrives in the ghost town to wait for a busload of investors, and find that an old lady (Alice Krige) and her adopted son (Mark Burnham) are still living in an abandoned orphanage.  The ghost town is going to get renovated by one man, Richter (Moe Dunford), who doesn\\'t take to the group.  Leatherface finally makes a questionable appearance, there\\'s a lot of questions throughout, and the carnage begins.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe timeline for the TCM franchise is even more convoluted than the Halloween franchise.  The film is barely over eighty minutes long, so there isn\\'t a lot of character development or legacy building, although I did see director Garcia paying tribute to some other famous slasher films here and there.  The script tries to inject something different into its story, addressing the influencer craze without going overboard with it.  Garcia\\'s direction works with well with the film\\'s editing, and this is a tightly shot flick, although Bulgaria makes a lousy substitute for the Lone Star state- I\\'m a fourth generation born Texan, and know my birth state pretty well.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem here is, of course, the script.  Characters not only make bad decisions, they make idiotic decisions that literally get themselves and others killed.  While some of them evolve and put up a fight against Leatherface, they also open themselves up to their own demise because if they didn\\'t, the movie would be even shorter.  The gore and violence is over the top, and I was very surprised that it got an (R) rating.  The special effects are very well done, but also very convincing, to the point that this isn\\'t a \"fun\" horror film.  \"Terrifier\" was also a gory slasher/horror film, but it had tension and suspense.  \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" has little tension, and viewers asking aloud \"why did they just do that?!\" instead.  One set-piece on a bus was probably set up as the be-all end-all of gruesome mass murder, but it becomes a nihilistic exercise in tedium.  In this day and age, it\\'s sad that we\\'ve become so numb, this is considered entertainment to be \"enjoyed\" again and again, considering that the original film, aside from one of the greatest titles of all-time, wasn\\'t as gory as you would expect.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think it\\'s okay to finally put this franchise to rest, it debuted on streaming because of some disastrous pre-release screenings so don\\'t look for it on physical media anytime soon.  I didn\\'t hate it as much as some viewers and critics did; I guess I\\'m old school, looking for the horror in my horror films.',\n",

       "     'content': \"The Adam Project is a sci-fi movie that takes you on a wild, CGI-filled flight that is out of this world-with futuristic technology that makes you excited but also afraid of what could come, The sci-fi elements look so realistic - as realistic as those can be - that it gives the impression that the cinematographers used time travel themselves to capture these scenes.\\r\\n\\r\\nExceptional fight scenes that defy gravity. This film also takes you into some very realistic topics, too, like grieving for a loved one, being bullied by classmates and accepting who you are.\\r\\n\\r\\nRyan Reynolds is in front of us with the same character he has been playing for the last 15 years.\\r\\nWhat really surprises me is the harmony of someone like Reynolds, who was in front of the camera with the world's greatest actors and actresses, with Walker Scobell, who had his first acting experience at the age of 12.  They made a great duo team.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe overall storyline of the movie is creative, but it does not really have any unique plot twists nor is it fully developed. And as a result, this film comes off a little bland and seems to be missing something.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt doesn't promise much as it is what we've always been seeing but it's pretty good at delivering what it promises. \\r\\nLong story short, 'The Adam Project' is a movie made to entertain the audience and it succeeds.\\r\\n•\\r\\n•\\r\\nEnjoyment Rating: 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟/5\\r\\n•\\r\\nOverall Score: 8.0/10\",\n",

       "     'content': '**Full Analysis at Spotamovie.com** - **Intro** - Released in March 2022, The Adam Project is a movie for those who love Sci-Fi, actions, CGI, and those who wish to change their past to let any regrets disappear. The Adam Project delivers a combination of funny entertainment and some meaningful messages. Ryan Reynolds and the director, Shawn Levy, are back together after the incredible success of Free Guy. - **The Story** - Adam Reed is a young boy grieving his father’s death and suffering the pains of bullying. Then, one night he found a wounded pilot in his dad’s garage. The intruder needs Adam’s help because he risked everything for a secret mission to be back in time. But, the operation can’t fail because the world is in grave danger. The real challenge for the task is that both of them don’t like each other. So, some questions are mandatory: Who is the pilot? Why is this mission so dangerous for the world? And what is the reason that moves the pilot to this desperate operation? But also, what are we going to learn from this story? - **We will explain all of this in our review and analysis available at https://www.spotamovie.com/the-adam-project-review-and-explanation-critic-post-movie-netflix-movie-2022/**',\n",

It -{ ISN\\'T }- \"very likely\" to be released in Cinemas.( Made For STREAMING ).\\r\\n\\r\\n______________________________________________________\\r\\n\\r\\nEllie { Young Adam\\'s Mom }: \"This\\'s the third time you\\'ve been suspended for fighting\".\\r\\n\\r\\nYoung Adam: \"I know. You\\'d think I\\'d be better at it by now!!!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n______________________________________________________\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you\\'re someone who\\'s presently in the mood to take a -Welcome- Break from all the doom and gloom on the news right now and watch a movie that comes **\"FULL-CIRCLE\"** in the most Enthralling, Engaging, and indeed -{ Heartwarming }- of ways . . . then I wish to -Wholeheartedly- recommend \"The Adam Project\", **( TAP for short ),** to you. The only -Other- cinematic experience I\\'ve had where a film came Full-Circle in -Such- beautiful fashion, in -Recent- memory at least, would be the simply Fabulous \"SpiderMan: No Way Home\" **( \"SM-NWH\" ).** It is a picture that literally ( And -Very- Cleverly ) ties up loose ends within the -{ Entire }- Spiderman CANON of films, from as far back as 2002. It also just happens to be the -Last- Massive Blockbuster that I reviewed ; before going on an -Entirely- unplanned, ( but -Incredibly- refreshing ) \\'Extended 101-day hiatus from reviewing\\'.\\r\\n\\r\\nOk, so if you thought that the 13 yr. old \"Newcomer\" of said film, pint-sized thespian  Walker Scobell was a tremendous -Dramatic- actor, well, then you\\'d only be -Half- right. The fact of the mater is... he\\'s also a terrific **-COMEDIC-** talent, with seriously \"Impeccable\" timing, especially given that this is, get this ...his -{ First Ever }- movie or TV ( \\'Feature\\' ) appearance. Factor Walker\\'s \"Super-Fun\" performance in alongside a \\'full spectrum\\' of absolute **-{ \"POWERHOUSE!\" }-** deliveries from the film\\'s unequivocal ensemble principal cast of Protagonists ( Zoe Saldaña, Ryan Reynolds, Mark Ruffalo, Jennifer Garner,  ) . . . then add in some absolutely -Fantastic- ( & truly state of the art ) CGI, a genuinely -Mindblowing- grand finale set piece ...and the kind of fight choreography that you really have to -See- ...to believe . . . & you have a seriously, seriously exciting picture, indeed.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot to mention **FUNNY AS HELL!!!** I really hadn\\'t laughed so hard in a long time ; -since- ( about the 3rd time ) I watched SM-NWH, to be precise. On the downside, though . . . & if I\\'m to be \\'painfully\\' honest . . . -Both- the Villain ( ...don\\'t get me wrong, the person who plays the main \\'baddie\\' is a Veteran performer ; I just felt like the Writing there could have been just that \"Little Bit Stronger\"... ) -And- her \\'ever loyal\\' henchman are a \\'tad weak\\', as is the very title of the film, itself. Even something as ( relatively ) simple as **\"FLASH-BACK-FORWARD\",** would have been -{ Far }- catchier than its existing name, ( although I do think I sorta understand -Why- they called it what they did, for what it\\'s worth ). It\\'s for these two reasons -Alone- that I -Didn\\'t- give it my trademark \"25/10\" ; reserved especially for movies That Move Me **-{ VERY }-** Deeply, as TAP ( ...quite obviously... ) -Did-.\\r\\n\\r\\nSummary: This is a picture that, ( among -several- other things ), pointedly asks the question: If you could -{ Somehow }- go back in time, & talk to your Younger-Self... **\"WHAT\\'D YOU SAY?\"** ...& in the most -Intriguing- of ways, at that. Furthermore, having lost my Dearly Beloved Father when I was -Just- 13, in a horrible, brutal car crash, TAP resonated with me **PROFOUNDLY.** It is has some Genuinely **\"TENDER\"** Moments, &  does a **-Phenomenal-** job of addressing the issue of \\'Estranged Father-Son Relationships\\' the world over, but most especially in the USA ; ( where the film is also -Set- ) ; and where the issue is quite possibly now almost at epidemic levels, what with the country\\'s sky-high divorce rate, separation rate, & just plain old \\'Absentee Father-ism\\', in general. All said & done, the  **\"EVER-DYNAMIC!** Duo\" of Actor Ryan Reynolds & Director Shawn Levy have well & truly \"Done it Again\". Although this **-ISN\\'T-** a Marvel movie, It -does- star a **\"Handful Of Marvel\\'s Best & Brightest\"** and -is- ultimately, \" A ( not so ) little cinematic streaming **MARVEL** 🌠 \", in its \\'Very Own Right\\'. Sadly, I\\'m not able to give TAP my \\'Absoluuut-High-Score\\' ( as I explained a bit earlier ), but it -Still- earns a **\"Majestic, Rock Solid 13 Marks Out Of 10 Marks\"** from me . . . **NONETHELESS!!!**',\n",

       "     'content': 'Despite having shades of _Back to the Future_, _The Adam Project_ finds a way to pave its own path to deliver a fun and heartwarming story about self-forgiveness. The movie starts incredibly strong, introducing the viewer to the main characters. The chemistry between the two actors is fantastic and feels really genuine, creating an instant connection between the two and the audience. Walker Scobell does an excellent job doing his best Ryan Reynolds impersonation, making me really buy into the fact that they are the same character. This pace carries on up until the second act when characters and lore are being thrown at the viewer left and right. This section feels incredibly rushed resulting in the viewer having very little emotional connection with the ideas introduced. Zoe Saldana and Mark Ruffalo do a fantastic job with the limited screen time that they have, it was great seeing them outside of their standard CGI suits (looking at you Marvel). The antagonist wore her welcome towards the end of the film as her antics seemed a little forced. The comedy in this movie was done fairly well. I enjoyed the fast sarcastic nature of the boy and his back and forth with Reynolds, but some jokes did fall flat. But that is par for the course in any comedy. Overall, this film was enjoyable and even though it had its faults I appreciated the concepts it delivered.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Verdict:** _Good_',\n",

I watched this movie with low expectations due to Netflix's disappointing track record of mediocre original movies. Each actor felt typecast into roles they had played before but still delivered meaningful performances. The effects and production were fairly typical of a Netflix project. But even though I can't say each specific part of The Adam Project was particularly remarkable, the sum of all its parts was fantastic! The writing mixed with the cast's solid performances just equals something great. The standout by far was Walker Scobell's excellent portrayal of young Ryan Reynolds.\",\n",

It isn't anything special as the film is missing a certain sort of spark to it, though the story is fun and allows for some interesting and rather sweet scenes; the latter is particularly true for the conclusion, which is well produced.\\r\\n\\r\\nReynolds himself is solid in the lead role, his performance is more serious than funny but there are still a fair amount of amusing moments for him across the 100 or so minutes. Walker Scobell gives a good showing behind the main man, his comedic timing in the first few scenes really does mirror Reynolds'.\\r\\n\\r\\nElsewhere on the cast, Mark Ruffalo, Zoe Saldaña and Jennifer Garner are decent.

       "     'content': 'When a bird finds it\\'s way into their living room, the young \"Tinja\" (Siiri Solalinna) wraps it in a cloth and gives it to her mother - who promptly breaks it\\'s neck! Somewhat distraught by this, the young would-be gymnast is out in the forest later where she discovers an egg. She takes it home, and incubates what turns out to be a rather large creature that has a distinct symbiosis with her. As it grows and develops, it can clearly read her mind and act upon her thoughts and actions as it develops human (and cruel) traits. Will she be able to control this rather menacing looking hatchling - especially in the face of increasing animosity towards her increasing domineering mother (Sophia Heikkilä) and annoying and scheming little brother? The story is all a bit too predictable here, to be honest, and the acting isn\\'t really up to much either - the direction and photography offers us just a bit too pristine a look to the film to help engender any sense of peril. The creature is well put together, though, and that does illicit a combination of pity and fear when used to it\\'s best effect. Sadly that is all too infrequently and for the most part this is a rather clunky family melodrama. Watchable, though, just not really very memorable.',\n",

       "     'content': '_Speak No Evil_ is an eerily realistic horror film that created incredible tension with the simplest interactions. Each incident escalates beyond comfortability leaving the family with the option of politeness or confrontation, with them choosing the former the entire movie. The scenes create a sense of awkwardness, where the audience is begging the family to remove themselves from the situation, but they remain. This is positive and a negative for the film. These choices the family make kept me engaged to see what happens next. But at the same time, it was incredibly frustrating to see baffling character choices be the vehicle for the plot. Despite that fact, the tension is built and remains throughout the runtime. Even though this movie had periods where it was quite slow, they never stayed for long without another problem being added to the list. I enjoyed it, but there are pacing problems that restricted me from being fulling ingulfed in the film.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Score:** _70%_ |\\r\\n**Verdict:** _Good_',\n",

       "     'content': \"First of all, let me say that I don't rate movies based on happy ending or bad ending. I rate them by their impact. If movie had an impact on you, if it affected you, this means movie was strong and achieved its goal, doesn't matter if it's a positive or negative impact. And Based on my criteria, this movie is 10/10! This movie actually traumatized me. I have seen a lot of horror movies, but this one affected me a lot, because unlike those paranormal movies about demons, devil and etc, this one is realistic, which means this what happened in this movie, might be happening in real somewhere. And when we - viewers watch movies, we feel for main characters and what I felt for them in this movie was very big pain. It left me very angry and whole night I had last scenes in my mind when I was lying in bed, because I was imagining what if I was in their place... I won't give you a spoiler, but be warned, if you're sensitive person and if you decide to watch it, it will traumatize you. It's a masterpiece, but with a very sad and bad ending.\",\n",

Second time in roughly three weeks that I've had the pleasure of seeing a Mark Rylance flick on the big screen and again he delivers - such a reliable actor. The other release was <em>'The Phantom of the Open'</em>, which is very good but both the film and Rylance's performance is bettered here. A thoroughly enjoyable showing from him as Leonard Burling.\\r\\n\\r\\nThings start off extremely strongly with a terrific opening scene with Rylance's Burling, so I was praying that it would keep that high level and I'm pleased to say that - in my opinion, of course - it absolutely did. There's a bit at the end that I was initially unsure about, though upon further thought I enjoyed it just as much as the rest.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne element of this 2022 production actually stays the same from start-to-finish, I won't say what but early on I thought it may limit proceedings but if anything it just adds to the overall vibe of it all. The support cast, meanwhile, are all faces I didn't know before now, though every one of them give good performances - standouts being Johnny Flynn and Nikki Amuka-Bird.\",\n",

       "     'content': 'I will give any production with Mark Ryland in it a try, ever since I first noticed him in Wolf Hall. I enjoyed this film, with its taut script, realistic dialogue and several plot twists, which I won’t even mention for fear of giving things away.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis movie manages to be a noir piece, even though it doesn’t venture out into the dark and moody streets of Chicago. It is a set piece, taking place in one man’s tailor shop. I wonder if a theatrical production on Broadway is inevitable?\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are plenty of bad guys to be found here, but with enough shading of humanity as to make us root for a few of them over the others. But the script doesn’t care who you root for — the plot is the plot and it will runs its headlong course and draw us along with it.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the periodic outbursts of violence, this is more a drama than a thriller. It reminds me of what Hitchcock is supposed to have said. Suspense isn’t a bomb exploding but rather it is wondering if it will go off. Of course, in thrillers, if you have a bomb, it must explode at some point. This movie isn’t that predictable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Outfit isn’t just a drama; it is a character study, and Ryland’s character bears up well under the plot’s scrutiny.',\n",

       "     'content': \"The Outfit is an isolated who-done it set in the late 1950's as a group of mobsters desperately try to find the rat in their crime organization. The setting was superb and nostalgic, and the set is fixed to one room for the entire film, which really aided in the paranoia of the film.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis isolation led to the film primarily being carried by dialogue and exposition, which was superb here. The script and dialogue were complex and clever, and the performances worked great in conjunction with it. Mark Rylance stole the show, he was sweet and calm, but had suspiciousness to him that led the audience to believe he knew more than he was letting on. He outshined everyone in this film. Zoey Deutch was lackluster as she really didn't seem to play a character that was believable. Her delivery was very modern day. Johnny Flynn and Dylan O'Brien were fine, but Simon Russell Beale was a surprise. For the small time he was here, I really enjoyed his menacing presence and his chemistry with Rylance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis film has multiple layers of mystery to it, and it was a joy to watch them unfold on the screen. However, I believe that there was too much towards the end. I was very satisfied with the twists and turns up to the end of the film, but then they just became absurd and over the top. I really did not connect with the final few twists and ultimately it hurts the enjoyment of the film in totality.\\r\\n\\r\\nScore: 81%\\r\\nVerdict: Great\",\n",

       "     'content': 'Not exactly my cup of tea, but still fantastic. Needless to say, this was an interesting film, and it\\'s nice to get away from Hollywood for a change. Though it wasn\\'t particularly a \\'must-rewatch\\'. And there was a sequence or two that may have been a bit predictable, and maybe a few things here and there. But there were definitely quite a ton of aspects I really liked and honestly just wasn\\'t expecting.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe thing that stood out the most was the way they utilized a single location and a relatively small cast. They way they did so much with so little makes it feel a lot more like a folk film or indie film. The idea of the entire story surrounding just one location would seem boring, lackluster and just interesting. But luckily, this isn\\'t the case. There are some pretty high stakes when it comes to the vulnerable kids, and the scenes of Jessica\\'s fight against Sammy (no spoilers) especially caught me off guard, and really kept the anxiety and tension high.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo at the end of the day, the Daily Wire did a fantastic job of giving us a Hollywood-quality thriller film that focuses on telling a good and unique story instead of pushing \"the message\". 7.5/10.',\n",

       "     'content': \"**A very well-made film, in which the biggest flaw is trying to make a teenage love eternal.**\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat happens after we die is one of the mysteries that has preoccupied the human race forever and remains unsolved. Of course, this will continue because Man's incessant search for more knowledge is doomed to hit insurmountable limits, barriers that we cannot penetrate. That is, despite his will, Man is not supposed to know everything. However, faith has proposed a lot of answers to the question of death, and there is not, I think, a single religion that does not defend the existence of life after the moment when the heart stops beating. What changes is what each religion and belief system proposes for that existence, and the way it seeks to advocate that proposal.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe don't know what religion believed Tessa and Skylar, the two main characters in the film, which never touches on issues of faith or religion at any time. We only know about the teenage love story they live, during a very short period of time that ends suddenly, when they have an accident, he dies, and she is injured. Times later, she begins to notice strange things, which lead her to believe that her late boyfriend is trying to communicate with her. The script is good, the story is nice, we quickly see a strong influence of the movie “Ghost” in this cinematographic work, and much of the story takes place in flashback, but it is relatively easy for us to understand when they start and when they end.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, and despite the qualities, we have to recognize that the film does not bring anything new and that there are many overly sugary moments, in which the romance is served with excessive doses of sweetness and fussiness, normal for a teenage couple, but deeply irritating for the mentality of more adult and mature people. Let's face it, it was a summer dating! It was almost certainly not the great love of Tessa's life. I don't know that many couples who met each other in their teens and stayed together for all (or almost all) of their lives. It just doesn't happen on a regular basis, and it's difficult for us, however painful and traumatic the situation for the young girl may be, for her loss to be comparable to a mother who loses a child, or a child who loses her mother or something. And the supernatural and the existence of spirits or “ghosts” does not make sense to all people, even when their faith beliefs admit their existence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe protagonists are Kyle Allen and Joey King, two very young actors who still have a long way to go if they want to keep their careers active in the world of cinema and television. I can't say they didn't do well… in fact, considering their youth, they both seem to have done a very satisfying job, especially King, who has more screen time, better material and more experience as an actress. The chemistry between the two is also good, it works quite well and lends some credibility to their romance. There is, however, something missing, a spark of intensity and maturity.\\r\\n\\r\\nTechnically, the film consistently relies on CGI and digital and computer-made special effects. It's something increasingly common, and dealing with a movie with a supernatural theme, it was difficult to escape it and avoid spending a good sum of money on good effects. I liked them, in general, especially the effect of the TV static, the mirror that breaks and the slow motion that follows (which reminded me of “Matrix” with their bullets). The bluish cloud that follows the car and that starts to drive it, after a certain moment, seemed to me cliché and exaggerated. The film makes use of a fairly regular cinematography, but well executed, with good colors and good lighting, and the editing was well done, giving the film a very safe and pleasant rhythm. The locations used for filming, the sets and the costumes are predictable, and the soundtrack is not memorable.\",\n",

       "     'content': \"With Dual, the story beats are a bit predictable but Karen Gillan’s purposely flat yet absorbing performance and the sheer thought of having to face yourself in a duel to the death while some clone imposter takes over your life make the film worthwhile. It’s definitely a different kind of film outside of the mainstream, but it also falls slightly short of expectations. Riley Stearns is capable of being funny and has proven that before in the past, but Dual fails to really capitalize on being laugh out loud funny. It’s an unorthodox twist on a familiar concept that attempts to dive into unexplored territory. However, Dual isn't able to fully immerse itself in the offbeat absurdities that tend to make Riley Stearns films so enjoyable.\\r\\n\\r\\nFull review: https://hubpages.com/entertainment/Dual-2022-Review-The-Imitation-of-an-Eccentric-Film\",\n",

       "     'content': \"Watched Dual last night/this morning. Bloody fantastic film. I thought it was just going to be yet another low-brow SFX laden action thing with loads of fight scenes, not really my thing, but Karen Gillan was in it, so I thought I'd give it a go before crashing out. Not at all what I expected. It's actually a really clever dystopian black comedy with fantastic performances from everybody involved. It's getting a lot of hate, seemingly because many others thought it was going to be the same film I thought it was, but unlike me, they were disappointed it wasn't actually that. The interesting thing about it is, it seems designed to have two seemingly open possibilities of how it ended, but in reality depending on which people choose to accept, you can see how closely they paid attention and thought deeply (or not) about the film. If you want an action movie, give it a miss, but if you like cerebral black comedies, watch it ASAP!\",\n",

       "     'content': \"The takeaway from Against the Ice is that not all CGI is bad — which doesn’t necessarily mean that some of it is good, only that some examples are comparatively worse than others. There is a scene in this movie that will remind you of The Revenant, except that the bear in Alejandro González Iñárritu’s film is one of its most memorable aspects; as for the one in Against the Ice, let’s just say that I’ve seen more realistic polar bears in those Coca-Cola Christmas ads. \\r\\n\\r\\nNow, both scenes involve lots of computer generated imagery and a stuntman pretending to be a carnivorous mammal of the Ursidae family, so the difference between awesome and pathetic lies in the performance of the actor being attacked.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike in pro wrestling, the encounter between Leo DiCaprio and the bear may not have been spontaneous, and its outcome may have been predetermined, but that doesn’t mean the actor didn’t take an actual beating, getting thrown around to and fro like a ragdoll by way of wires; moreover, all of his facial and body language is committed to selling the gravity of the situation, which in turn makes the bear, CGI or not, look like a million bucks. Meanwhile in Against the Ice, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau pretty much just lies there, bringing no urgency to what should be a life-and-death struggle.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis scene is symptomatic of Against the Ice, which is no less a collection of clichés than The Revenant, but whereas the latter amounts to much more than the sum of its parts thanks to superb execution, the former is too conventional to ever transcend its chosen genre. \\r\\n\\r\\nConsider the way it tracks the passage of time beginning with “Day 1”, which is of course a logical starting point, but also a very obvious one; from there it skips all the way to “Day 26” — my question is, since apparently nothing of note happened in the first 25 days, why not just start with the 26th day and go from there? \\r\\n\\r\\nAll things considered, no one will be surprised to learn that Ejnar Mikkelsen (Coster-Waldau) — on whose book (or, presumably, a translation of the same, seeing as how the Danish characters all speak English as a first language) the movie is based — and Iver Iverson (Joe Cole) “remained friends for life”, but don’t they always? Just like Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush in the King’s Speech, or Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali in Green Book. \\r\\n\\r\\nAll movies “based on a true story” take extreme liberties with their source material, and I usually hate it when they do, but Against the Ice would have been considerably less trite if the makers had gone the opposite route with the characters’ relationship; after all, in the words of Mr. Burns following a similar but by no means as protracted ordeal, “once you've been through something like that with a person, you never want to see that person again.”\",\n",

Last year he managed to save Bliss from Salma Hayek’s strident overacting, but he has no such luck with Jennifer Lopez in Marry Me. \\r\\n\\r\\nNow, to be fair, the movie’s failure is not her fault, and she acquits herself a lot better than Hayek did; it also helps that Lopez is essentially playing herself – a mega popstar with a string of failed marriages. And whereas she isn’t an acting prodigy, nor is, for that matter, Maluma, who plays her temporary fiancee, they are nevertheless performers who know their way around a stage and are extremely comfortable in front of an audience.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s no surprise then that the only genuine moments in Marry Me take place during a sold-out show – that is, of course, until Kat Valdez (Lopez), having discovered, right before they are supposed to tie the knot in between musical numbers that Bastian (Maluma) has been unfaithful, has what can only be termed as a psychotic break and decides to pick out a random dude from the audience and marry him on the spot instead. Let’s put it like this: this plot is too outlandish even for Wilson, and he has been in several Wes Anderson films.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reason that Charlie (Wilson) is at the concert is pretty random itself; Parker (Sarah Silverman), her friend and colleague – they are both teachers, or at least he is a math teacher that, as it often occurs in the movies, has only a handful of students in his charge; she on the other hand mostly appears to just hang around the school –, planned to attend the show with her girlfriend, but her girlfriend broke up with her, so she asks Charlie to come and bring her daughter along. \\r\\n\\r\\nOk, so this is the hottest show in town – sold out, as I mentioned above –, but Parker just happens to conveniently have a third ticket available; still harder to believe is that her girlfriend didn't wait until after the concert to break up with her.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnyway, that very same night Kat is already the butt of Jimmy Fallon’s jokes on The Tonight Show – which is obviously impossible because The Tonight Show doesn’t air live; in fact, it is taped in the afternoon and broadcast hours later. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut who knows? Maybe Jimmy is clairvoyant and, having seen the whole thing coming, pre-taped a few pertinent jokes. All things considered, you know you’re in big trouble when your movie makes less overall sense than Notting Hill.\",\n",

The outlandish concept of a pop star spontaneously marrying a random fan in the crowd, feeding the media circus, and then accidentally falling in love might seem far-fetched, but in today's world not completely impossible. Marry Me tries to tell the story Notting Hill for a new audience but falls short by rushing the story and forgetting to make the romance believable. It all just happens without convincing or satisfying its audience. Lopez and Wilson's awkward escapades are still enjoyable to watch but not enjoyable enough for a second viewing.\",\n",

       "     'content': \"**Classic horror formula brought back to haunt our modern times**\\r\\n\\r\\nI do feel this movie has a potential to one day become a classic of it's own. A good horror movie takes the things that plague the everyday lives of it's contemporary audience and exposes their dark side, but without spelling things out. Resulting in the audience feeling very uneasy, but not knowing exactly why. All classic horror movies pull that off and this one does an equally good job targeting a modern audience with modern issues.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike with all horror movies that apply this formula (and all the good ones ALWAYS do) this movie therefore relies on building things up in the first act and having the audience relate to the characters and their relatable everyday issues and interpersonal conflicts. Which might seem dull (especially for today's audience with its notoriously short attention span) but it's an absolutely crucial and necessary build up for the 3rd act in which the *bleep* will finally hit the fan.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo while the everyday problems of an average modern family might seem boring to sit through and might seem like they have nothing to do with the scary monster that will figuratively and/or literally, but inevitably show up at the end, it in reality has EVERYTHING to do with it and actually any monster is merely the personification of the dark aspects of the issues that are addressed in the first act.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, like so many horror movies nowadays, this movie includes some references to the occult. But unlike in many other horror movies, these occult aspects are not in any way glorified, yet are portrayed fairly accurately, though of course taken with a slight artistic license. Which I think is what you would want. I mean after all and assuming black magic is real, you wouldn't want your audience accidentally summoning the dark forces after casually reciting some dialogue from the latest haunted house movie :-)\",\n",

       "     'content': 'I’m sorry to report that Alyssa Milano does not forego her long-standing ‘no nudity clause’ in Brazen — and I’m more sorry for her than for me (after all, I’ve seen Embrace of the Vampire), because that’s about the only thing that could save this mess. Milano is Grace Miller, authoress of thriller novels. Here is an excerpt from her most recent masterpiece, titled Brazen Virtue:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She did not expect to die that night. Sara Bowman was precise in everything, and dying was not on her agenda. She had no enemies that she knew of. In general, his life was quite ordinary. Yet there she was, lying in a pool of her own blood. The manner of her death violent, even deranged. Who would want to kill the ordinary Sara Bowman? And then it dawned on her. What if she wasn’t ordinary? What if she had a secret life?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would have to be a very secret secret life indeed if not even “Sarah” herself was aware of it. It turns out that Brazen is based on a novel also called Brazen Virtue by Nora Roberts; I’m not familiar with her work, but I wouldn’t be surprised if her books opened with the phrase “It was a dark and stormy night” or some variation thereof.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to a purveyor of purple prose, Grace is a dispenser of clumsy exposition, like when she tells her sister Kathleen (Emilie Ullerup) that “Last I heard you were addicted to pills and you abandoned your son.” Something tells me this is not news to Kathleen, who is an English teacher at an upper-class boys’ high school: “Next week’s essay will be on Hamlet. How would Hamlet feel in our digital age?\\r\\n\\r\\nI’m pretty sure Ethan Hawke already answered this question, and the answer wasn’t very compelling (besides, a better question would be how would Romeo feel in the digital age, considering that a simple SMS would have saved him a lot of trouble).\\r\\n\\r\\nWould you believe that Kathleen herself just happens to have a double life of her own? Well, she does; her alter ego is Desiree, a web cam dominatrix. Wait, what? I guess all her customers must be naughty little boys, because for a fetish based on discipline, this is incredibly lazy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnyway, Kathleen soon gets sent to web cam heaven, and Grace hijacks her sister’s homicide investigation, which is nominally led by Detective Ed Jennings (Sam Page) — who conveniently lives next-door to Kathleen — and his partner, Detective Ben Parker (Malachi Weier), who may be named after Spiderman’s uncle, but he looks like the lead singer in a Melvins cover band.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrace talks Ed and Ben’s boss, Captain Rivera (Alison Araya) into appointing her a “consultant” on the case (someone’s been watching too much Lucifer). Grace justifies this claiming that “I have an instinct for motive. I mean, that’s why my books are so successful. I can enter the mind of a murderer, especially those who attack women.”\\r\\n\\r\\nEd, who is present and opposes the idea, fails to point out that Grace would be a pretty lousy writer (well, lousier) if she couldn’t freely enter the mind of a killer that she made up in the first place.\\r\\nUnchecked, Grace adds, “Do you know how long it took the NYPD to find the Times Square Rapist? Eight months. And I went in, studied the case, and they caught the guy three days later.” Again, it doesn’t cross Ed’s mind to call this a coincidence or suggest that the guy was caught thanks to those eight months of police work, and not Grace’s three days.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Captain, who must have found her badge in a cereal box, is sold, however; “Grace, I read your books from cover to cover as soon as I can get my hands on them. You truly are one of the most cunning profilers out there.” Thankfully, the scene ends before the brownosing becomes literal.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat I don’t understand is why director Monika Mitchell — and that a woman directed this, as it were, brazen display of pseudo-feminism is most baffling — goes to such lengths to promote Grace as a prodigious detective mind when she never even comes close to determining the killer’s identity or motive (despite having “lots of ideas” about it), or why screenwriters Edithe Swensen and Donald Martin force Milano to say, with all the sincerity she can muster, that Grace’s novels are “about the exploitation of women and misogyny and patriarchy and how we do very little to protect the most vulnerable”, only to have her catch the villain by literally using her body as bait. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt may contain no full-frontal nudity, but Brazen is nonetheless one of the most embarrassing movies Milano has ever been in (for what it’s worth, she’s a stone-cold MILF, though).',\n",

       "     'content': \"No character has a name in this, but Clint Eastwood it isn't. Zac Efron is taking a pee out in the desert when he spots an uncommonly large deposit of gold. His pal Anthony Hayes and he try to move it, but it's just too big. Plan? Well Hayes decides to head to the nearest town to try and procure some heavy lifting equipment and leaves Zac to keep watch. Hmmm? Well, anyway Hayes isn't exactly rushing back to his friend who is gradually running out of food, water, having hallucinations, fending off wild dogs and even a rogue Irish women as his grasp on reality starts to slip... Efron is actually not bad as the man who gradually succumbs to despair and dehydration, but the story plods along far too slowly for almost eighty minutes before the last ten minutes provide a denouement with a bit of a twist to the tale. It is good that Efron is pushing himself away from his pretty boy roles - indeed the make-up folks here do such a good job that I doubt even a biblical leper would welcome him into their home, but the story all takes way too long to get going and the it, quite literally, crawls along. The production does look good - the desert photography has an almost naturally sepia colour to it that emphasises just how hostile this terrain is and the narrative does say something about the degree to which greed is hard wired into our psyche though; and the perils we will endure or permit to obtain wealth. Thought provoking? Maybe, but it's still really quite a wearisome watch and I'm not sure I would bother again.\",\n",

       "     'content': \"At the risk of sounding like a purist, Jackass Forever is one comeback too many. I’m aware that expecting purity from this franchise is akin to drawing blood from the proverbial stone, but even when taken on its own terms, it’s safe to say that there is no Jackass without Bam Margera and Ryan Dunn – just like there wouldn’t be any Jackass sans Johnny Knoxville or Steve-O. To its credit, JF doesn’t try to replace the irreplaceable, but it does attempt to fix what’s not broken by injecting ‘new blood’ into the cast (come to think of it, it's definitely broken, and it doesn't get fixed either).\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, we get a new fat guy, even though the old fat guy is still around (and still round). Why? You already have a fat dude; you don’t need two fat dudes. Similarly, with the likes of Dave England, known for his ability – if one can call it that – to defecate on cue, what need is there for a Dave England-lookalike named Poopies? All of this makes as much sense as having another little person on set other than Wee Man – and again, I know that ‘sense’ doesn’t enter the equation here, but just because the performers are dumb enough to do what they do to themselves, it doesn’t mean that the fan base, among whose numbers I count myself, is too dumb to have its intelligence insulted.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no point in introducing newcomers this late in the game, especially considering that, as JF makes abundantly clear, watching random strangers suffering grievous bodily harm isn’t all that funny; ironically, it’s much funnier when it happens to people you have come to know and actually like over the years – and even then the novelty has doubtless finally worn off (and it certainly had a damn good run); there is a lot more deja vu in the proceedings than there is nostalgia. All things considered, I was considerably more entertained by Knoxville’s match with Sami Zayn at Wrestlemania 38 than by Jackass Forever.\",\n",

       "     'content': \"As actors, even playing fictionalized versions of themselves, the Foo Fighters are terrific musicians. Fans of the band needn't worry though; based on the evidence of Studio 666, the Foos won’t be quitting their day jobs any time soon. This movie appears to be shooting for the same cult classic status as Kiss Meets the Phantom of the Park, but I think it’s more likely to inspire suicide cults than anything else – I know I would gouge my eyes out and then bleed to death rather than watch it again.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s a shame, because Studio 666 had the chance and the potential to be more This is Spinal Tap than Phantom of the Park. Spinal Tap is a comedy about a rock band on the road; Studio 666 could have given us the making-of-the-album version of the story – and, like the proverbial broken clock, it's spot-on a couple of times (the moment where Dave Grohl “finds” a new, previously unknown musical note which he calls “L sharp” is in a way reminiscent of Nigel Tufnel’s “D minor is really the saddest of all keys”), but these occasions are so few and far between as to make the experience even more frustrating.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is possible to make an intelligent, funny movie about the recording process; 2014’s Frank is a great example, especially because that film, as eclectic as it is, doesn’t feel the need to experiment beyond its area of expertise. Contrastingly, Studio 666 has a streak of cheesy horror running through it that is as out of place in a Foo Fighters movie as a song from Grohl’s heavy metal side project Probot would be in a Foo Fighters album. I mean, we like the Foos the same way we like Eminem – but then, we wouldn’t like Eminem as much if 8 Mile had been a supernatural slasher instead of a semi-autobiographical drama.\\r\\n\\r\\nI’m not saying, though, that Studio 666 should have been a drama, only that it would have behooved it, even as a comedy, to be more veridical. Grohl’s rockstar outbursts would be a lot funnier if they stemmed from his overzealous quest to make a perfect record, as opposed to his being possessed by an evil spirit or whatever; it’s almost as if he’s so afraid of damaging his good-guy image that he has to justify playing against it with a case of ‘the devil made me do it.’\",\n",

It\\'s just a sequence of points, as it culminates with a woeful, forced family drama.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cast make it slightly more watchable than it would\\'ve otherwise been, I will say that - they aren\\'t great, but are predominantly hindered by the lame dialogue and yawnful character development. Zach Braff and Gabrielle Union are a solid pairing, while Mykal-Michelle Harris and Leo A. Perry are the pick of the younger lot - I would\\'ve liked to have seen more of their characters, as those two definitely had the best comedic timing of the kids. Others I note: <em>\\'<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_Dead\" rel=\"nofollow\">Talking Dead</a>\\'</em> favourite Ron Funches and <em>\\'<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/white-chicks/\" rel=\"nofollow\">White Chicks</a>\\'</em> alum Brittany Daniel.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only hero from this 2022 flick? Larry Sims. That dude went ham on Union\\'s hair - I\\'ve never noticed a character go through so many hairstyles before! Hope he got paid enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nI feel a tiny bit bad for disliking something that tries to come out meaningful, but man this is a cringefest.

       "     'content': 'I think the kingdom ought to have been called \"Agonise\" rather than \"Agonos\" for agony is pretty much the sentiment you have after one hundred minutes of this fantasy bobbins. The realm is under threat from invasion and it falls to \"Braedyn\" (Ryan Livingstone) to track down the last dragon and hope that it will agree to help him and his few courageous colleagues to thwart the demon lord \"Abaddon\" before everything is turned to ashes. This has two things that really work against it. It has obviously been made on a tiny budget and so the single camera combat photography and the very limited special effects do it no favours at all. Secondly, there is a distinct paucity of dragon! It does try to be a bit darker, their seemingly invincible masked opponents do emit a little menace, but it\\'s far too wordy and the cast just don\\'t make much of an impact with a rather well trammelled plot that joins the cinema dots all too predictably. Still, it\\'s not the worst and director Lawrie Brewster is possibly guilty of trying too hard here rather than not trying hard enough - especially given the limited talent of his, well, talent! It\\'s instantly forgettable television fodder, this - but if you like the genre (I do) then it\\'s still just about worth a watch.',\n",

       "     'content': 'Must have been tax return time for Pierce Brosnan as he \"stars\" in this daft historical fantasy about Louis XIV of France and his aspirations for immortality. Egged on by the ambitious \"Labarthe\" (Pablo Schreiber) he believes that he can live forever if her manages to get hold of a mermaid and - well, he pinches her life force. Snag is, though, his own daughter \"Mary-Josephe\" (Kaya Scodelerio) is not so supportive of this scheme when she discovers this distressed sea creature and so, of course, off we head into the turbulent waters of familial discord before a whopping great power ballad at the end. William Hurt crops up here, too, and Benjamin Walker provides some eye candy - but the story is Disney-lite, there is way too much verbiage and although Brosnan tries to ham it all up, he just looks like he couldn\\'t care less about any of it - a feeling with which I could pretty readily associate. It does look good, the costumes and Versailles look lovely but the rest of it is straight to video.',\n",

       "     'content': 'I’m unsure what After Yang tries to accomplish (does it want to be a cautionary tale about the evils of privacy-violating technology? A gentle meditation on the nature of memory? The manifesto for a hypothetical AndroidLivesMatter movement?), but I do know that whatever it is, it fails – just like Jake (Colin Farrell) and Kyra (Jodie Turner-Smith) fail to parent their little daughter Mika (Malea Emma Tjandrawidjaja).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe movie takes place in an indeterminate future where it is possible to buy “an older sibling for Chinese adoptions” (a possibility that is oddly specific). Some years before the events of the film, Jake and Kyra “bought Yang [Justin H. Min] to connect Mika to her Chinese heritage”; or, as Jake puts it, “teach her Chinese fun facts.” Pray tell, ¿why couldn’t they just have adopted two Chinese children, and have one be older than the other? Also, if they really want Mika to connect with her Chinese heritage, how about giving her a name that is, you know, Chinese? Though to be fair to writer/director Kogonada, I think Jake and Kyra are actually meant to be terrible parents; the real problem is that they don’t seem get any better at it by the end of the movie.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut let’s start with the beginning; after what appears to be a nationwide, or maybe even worldwide, rhythm-matching game in which “over 30,000 families” participate (the opening credits are accompanied by a montage of the film’s characters and their families engaging in this competition, suggesting an entirely different movie than the one we are about to watch), Yang conks out, setting the plot, such as it is, in motion.\\r\\n\\r\\nJake goes to a few places to have Yang repaired, and in the process the element of spyware is introduced, only to be quickly abandoned in favor of Yang’s “memory bank”. You see, “The memory banks allowed the technos [or techno-sapiens] to record a few seconds each day. The labs were trying to understand what technos considered memorable.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThis raises a number of questions that the movie can’t be bothered to bring up, let alone answer. Are these “few seconds” all that the technos ‘remember’ from each day? And if so, does that mean that whatever they don’t record is as good as if it never happened? And wouldn’t that leave them with the memory retention of a goldfish (or that of Guy Pearce in Memento)? Not exactly the kind of carer I would want to entrust my infant daughter with.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoreover, since we only see Yang interacting with the other characters in random snippets that make his life seem like a Terrence Malick film, we are unable to piece together exactly why he was so important to them. All things considered, I would have been more interested in the Before and the During than in the After Yang.',\n",

Pestered by the - frankly annoying - child, mum (Jodie Turner-Smith) and dad (Colin Farrell) decide it has to be fixed, so the latter takes it to a friend of a friend after it transpires their warranty doesn\\'t cover \"core\" failure. Anyway, his new diagnostician suspects that the chip that controls the young \"Yang\" might contain secret spyware - and suggests that he goes to visit a scientist who might be able to open up the chip and get to the truth. It\\'s got elements of iRobot (2004) to it, but otherwise I found it all a little too sterile. The story is delivered via flashbacks mixed within the contemporaneous plot, but essentially this is just a rather dry observation of a fairly unremarkable family whose toy has broken down. Such more sinister elements to the film as there are - a few big brother-esque themes - are largely undercooked. There is hardly any of Turner-Smith on screen, and what there is doesn\\'t gel at all well with a Farrell who has lost much of his on-screen charisma and is now little better than a jobbing actor whose face we recognise. Perhaps it does tell us something about love and of the nature of affection, but only superficially and I can\\'t say I found there to be much to write about with this. Sorry - it will look fine on the television, I wouldn\\'t bother a cinema with it.',\n",

The film is terrible and just because it is a black person belitteling the movement it seems to be allowed? It is possibly the worst film I have seem ain a long while.\\r\\n\\r\\nBasically a really bad reharsh of Big Momma\\'s house but devoid of any type of comedy. Every second seems like the actors are trying to impersonate Martin Lawrence/ Eddie Murphy style with no success whatsoever.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe intro starts with a man setting himself on fire with a barbecue in some sort of 19060\\'s Marx brothers parody, and the outdated \"\\'jokes\\' just keep going from there.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film even goes as far as making racist Alabama Jokes about incest. Which seem pathetic and archaic the the modern society of BLM. Almost goading places with inequatity such as Alabama to be more racist. \\r\\n\\r\\nA direct joke of BLM - Police relations and even a satirical parody of the Rosa Parks incident that launched equal rights movements.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is ever the introduction of Brendan O\\'Carroll for what seems to be the sole purpose of making outdated \\'n*gger\\' and cotton picking jokes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe discrimination doesn\\'t stop there with overtones of homophobia running throughout the beginning; a gay relationship getting no sympathy in comparison with the end of the straight relationship, seeming to question its equality or even its validity at all when the charachters return to refering to each other as \\'friends\\' after the breakup. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe film obviously tries to highlight modern sociological issues but constant overconcentration of skin colour and race seems more to mock the whole matter with the goal being to increase ineqaulity not diminish it. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis film shouldn\\'t have even been made this of the millenium. A definate push back to equality.',\n",

It is unique and told in a casual manner despite the high-stress circumstances that play out. Throughout the film, I tried to guess how it would play out, but the ending wrapped up unexpectedly. I can’t say Windfall was an incredible film, but it held my attention and felt different than a typical home invasion or robbery movie. Segel, Collins, and Plemons all played their characters in a way that kept the viewer off kilter and wondering what would happen next. Windfall keeps its characters shrouded in mystery, leaving the audience in the dark, only sharing small bits to develop the story. Windfall isn’t mind-blowing but entertains and intrigues right from the beginning.',\n",

Amber Gray\\'s character could have been better explored, as well as some secondary themes, which result in a loss of focus around the mid-section.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, the well-written script offers an informative point-of-view, allowing the viewers to feel the discrimination that the main characters suffer without ever making it a forced plot point.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe final scene with the end credits already rolling is a perfect conclusion to demonstrate the cultural and behavioral differences towards and between each race.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRating: B+',\n",

       "     'content': 'Doing some research, I find that women’s boxing rounds last just two minutes; that is, they are one minute shorter than in men’s boxing. That’s exactly how Catch the Fair One feels – like something’s missing. The ending is particularly frustrating, not because of how it plays out, but rather because it comes too soon – like a prize fight that concludes earlier than expected because one of the boxers has a glass jaw and gets, using Chris Tucker’s words from Friday, KTFO; the difference here is that it is the film, co-written and directed by Josef Kubota Wladyka, that KOs itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout revealing the specifics, let’s just say that there is nothing inherently wrong with an climax wherein pretty much everybody bites the dust; in fact, the greatest tragedies – i.e., Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet – end up with high body counts. However, even in death, we are left with the impression that the characters achieve something; Romeo and Juliet, for instance, manage to reconcile Capulets with Montagues, no less.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn contrast, CtFO leaves us hanging – wondering, ‘is this it?’. I’m not saying the movie should have a happy ending, because that’s probably the only way to make matters worse; on the other hand, even a happy ending would be an ending. To continue employing boxing terms, what happens here is more akin to a referee stoppage than any sort of cathartic resolution. By way of comparison, Rocky actually loses to Apollo Creed at the end of the original Rocky, and he still manages to come out triumphant. In that sense, I’m thinking CtFO would have benefitted from an ending along the lines of that of Promising Young Woman – in which the heroine’s sacrifice actually means something.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll things considered, the reason to watch CtFO is Kali Reis’s performance as Kaylee ‘K.O.’ Uppeshau, a woman so tough she sleeps with a razorblade in her mouth. Reis is a real-life boxer who gets a ‘story-by’ credit in CtFO, thus singlehandedly doing more to subvert the ‘dumb jock’ stereotype than most sports movies – or, for that matter, than most athletes (Kyrie Irving, the NBA player/flat-earther, or Aaron Rodgers, the vaccine-averse NFL quarterback come immediately to mind, but the examples are Legion). And for what it’s worth, this is a much better (that is to say, it’s a lot shorter) film about a female boxer than, say, Million Dollar Baby – the advantage of a rushed ending is that the movie at least doesn’t take more than two and half hours to eventually go nowhere, even if nowhere is where we wind up regardless.',\n",

       "     'content': 'Movies like this one never fail to remind me of Cameron Diaz’s \"crazy bitch mother\" character in My Sister’s Keeper. The difference is that we weren’t really meant to sympathize with Diaz until he eventually relented and stopped being such a bitch. Here, however, Melissa Leo achieves the seemingly impossible feat of making Bella Thorne comparatively likable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plot is your standard Roaring Rampage of Revenge disguised as a Shakespearean pastiche. Actress Lillian Cooper’s (Leo) son Curtis’s (Jake Weary) death parallels that of King Hamlet (down to one of his alleged assassins being called Claude, which is just a little too on the nose, if you ask me), and Lillian is as crazy as Ophelia — well, almost.\\r\\n\\r\\nCurtis dies from an apparent accidental overdose, but Lillian immediately suspects murder most foul — even though her son was a pseudo-rockstar with a history of substance abuse. She recruits Curtis’s dealer/photographer Taz (Thorne) to be the Horatio to her Hamlet (when they first meet, Lillian pulls a knife on Taz, and Taz obliquely threatens Lillian with a gun; needless to say, it’s the beginning of a beautiful friendship). \\r\\n\\r\\nMacbeth and The Merchant of Venice are also invoked, though to what end I haven’t the foggiest. There is also a reference to Poe’s The Imp of the Perverse that manages to be both plot-relevant and completely out of fucking nowhere; if you’re going to do Shakespeare, then do Shakespeare — or, better yet, don’t. \\r\\n\\r\\nI liked how Lillian uses a production of Hamlet she directs and acts in as an alibi, which in turn means she goes about the Revenge Business (some of it, at least) in the guise of the Ghost of Hamlet’s father; then again, as cool as that is, it of course makes zero fucking sense. All things considered, there was no reason to drag the Bard’s name into this incoherent mess.\\r\\n\\r\\nI must admit I’m not at all sure what exactly is it that happens in this movie, or if it even happens, but I think that’s more the filmmakers’ fault than mine. If Curtis’s death was indeed accidental, that leaves all of Lillian’s obvious mental issues unadressed.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other hand, if he was in fact murdered, that would mean Lillian is crazy like a fox (as opposed to just plain crazy), but what about motive? Sure, \"Curtis is going to be a bigger star now than ever before,\" but why kill the goose that lays the golden eggs? \\r\\n\\r\\nWhat we have here is ultimately all madness and no method. I don’t mind ambiguity, but this film is not ambiguous so much as it is contradictory. Pray tell, why on Earth is a movie titled Measure of Revenge that ends with the words \"Justice will be served\"?',\n",

       "     'content': 'This ought to be compulsory viewing for strikers and management alike. The fact that in the 21st century, we are still resorting to these antiquated sledgehammer tactics to deal with industrial disputes is frankly stupefying. Like they say about economic sanctions, they never effect the folks they are intended to, but the ordinary person on the street gets well and truly shafted. \"Julie\" (Laure Calamy) is one such person who is trying to juggle two-children single-parenthood with a shift job as the head chambermaid in a 5-star hotel whilst simultaneously trying to organise an interview with a market research company - her professional background - that will hopefully give her a better and more regular career and allow her to rely less on the increasingly wearying neighbour \"Mme. Lusigny\" (Geneviève Mnich) for childcare. The sense of exasperation felt by the woman throughout this film is palpable. You cannot help but feel sorry for her as she tries to juggle plates galore, keep a grasp on her sanity, keep her job, her temper and stay on the right side of her young children. Most of us who live (or have lived) in an urban area and who relied on mass transportation will appreciate just how poleaxing it can be to your entire life when the things stop running. Calamy\\'s strong and engaging characterisation here offers us a really plausible look at what exhaustion that can cause really looks like. The ending has a redemption to it that has you leaving the cinema with a smile, but for the most part this is actually quite an uncomfortably effective look at how the actions of some - regardless of politics - can seriously screw things up for others. Surely the time has now come for locked doors, bread, water and white smoke?',\n",

       "     'content': \"It’s a bright looking setting for such a dark time in history in Munich: The Edge of war - Everything looks colourful and stylish. \\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless Schwochow keeps the tension up right from the beginning. It’s a classic case of the audience knowing more than the characters. Helping with the tension is keeping the Germans speaking German. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe film has an impending doom about it. It's Titanic meets a world war with lots of people being wrong in their assurances of the future. This is fine, they're saying. The tension between the two leads Legat and von Hartmann reflects the tensions between the countries yet somehow in reverse. They are trying to reconcile while their countries irrevocably turn to war. The script is good enough not just to make these two characters overly simple.\\r\\n\\r\\nMcKay finds himself again being a messenger right back in the wars (after after he starred in 1917) with the world being on the verge of WWII. He just must be made of the right stuff - or at least the running stuff.\\r\\nIrons thrives as the miscalculating Chamberlain PM, while the film shows him to be harshly treated by history. Everyone seems anxious as if there was a war on or something.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe theme of personal need versus national duty comes up as well as the sacrifices required come in opposite directions when some are sacrificing for the country and others are against it. The film serves as inspiration and a warning for future skirmishes. \\r\\n\\r\\nViewers can be glad the filmmakers resisted the temptation of calling this Hitler’s Translator. It’s an effective international thriller since the audience know the ending and its accompanying tragedy.\",\n",

       "     'content': 'Full Analysis at Spotamovie.com **- Intro -** The lovers of negotiations, conspirators and historical dramas will enjoy the movie. The story focuses on the 1938 Munich Agreement. However, the director embraces the fictional way more than the historical one, and the film becomes an enjoyable drama enriched with some taste of a thriller. **- The Story -** In autumn 1938, Europe was on the brink of war. Hitler claimed back the territory of Sudetenland, belonging at that moment to Czechoslovakia. If Hitler invades the Czech, France and Britain must protect them. Prime Minister Chamberlain and his staff have less than 24 hours to find a diplomatic solution and prevent a tragic European conflict. Behind the lines, two old friends, Hugh Legat and Paul von Hartmann weave the web to keep the peace and change the course of history. The solution seems to be a quick agreement to give back to the Germans the Sudetenland. But will it be enough? Who are Hugh and Paul? And what is behind this story and the conspiracy? - **Full analysis at https://www.spotamovie.com/munich-the-edge-of-war-movie-review-and-explanation-2021-movie/**',\n",

       "     'content': \"A neat look behind the scenes of 'Turning Red', though not the most interesting. The actual film is very good, fwiw.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt's more about the people who made the film as opposed to the film itself, which is all fine but I'm always more interested in the onscreen stuff and the cast. We get to see a bit of Rosalie Chiang and a bit of Sandra Oh, but that's basically it. Animated films in general always seem to not showcase 'actors in the booth', which is kinda annoying. Like here, it's cool to see Oh in the booth - needed more of that for the whole cast! Of course, logistically that might not have been possible - though for this documentary they do send a separate camera crew to (pleasantly, I'd like to add) film a crew member's family so...\\r\\n\\r\\nThis also completely sidesteps the controversy of theatrical release vs. Disney+ release. As expected, no doubt, but it feels like a massive elephant - or, should I say, panda ... sorry - in the room throughout. In conclusion, this serves a purpose but it's not as interesting as it could've been - in my opinion, obvs. It does, at least, shed light on important real world topics to be fair.\",\n",

       "     'content': 'This is a must see for fans of great cinema music. Perhaps alongside John Williams and John Barry, the eponymous maestro has scored in an unique and innovative way, a great many films since the 1960s and this film tracks how he rose from a classical music training to an (eventual) Oscar winner. It does suffer from the perennial problem of films like this, we see (and hear) too little of his marvellous works - especially my own favourite \"Ecstasy of Gold\" - but the narrative offers a quickly paced series of contributions from those well known, and those less so. It is astonishing just how many films he did provide the music for, some of it truly memorable and some of it truly dreadful - but here we see a man who never shied away from pushing the boundaries. His creative use of vocals, even of a typewriter to create his sounds demonstrates well his almost boundless imagination. Though at times a little dry, this documentary lays that skill and passion engagingly before us. Bertolucci, Eastwood and Joffé all contribute in a fashion that avoids the adulatory, and makes this an enjoyable chronology not just of Morricone himself, but of world cinema too.',\n",

       "     'content': \"Just imagine. A builder on the roof of this ancient monument is having a fly cigarette. He throws the butt from the rooftop but instead of finding it's way to the ground, it is blown through one of the slitted windows whereupon it encounters some debris from a pigeon's nest and - well quite literally all hell breaks lose. Jean-Jacques Annaud intersperses real footage of this terrible conflagration with a drama offering us a plausible depiction of just how difficult it was for the Pompiers of Paris to not only tackle this blaze, but to get through the grid-locked streets of their city to the Île de la Cité in the first place. There is a palpable sense of the heat, the smoke - and the fear as the fire fighters tried to coax the water pressure into a meaningful tool to put out the fire whilst what seemed like gallons of molten lead slurped around the roof using the gargoyles as did Charles Laughton back in 1939. The dramatic elements are adequate, but to be honest they don't really matter - most of this is eye-watering. Certainly, you are pretty clearly aware of what is real and what has been staged - the intimate photography leaves us in little doubt of that, but again that doesn't really matter. This film demonstrates the courage and bravery of those tasked with stopping history burning down around them, whilst building on the response nightmare and the religiosity of those who can't quite believe God is allowing this to happen at all! It is all told pacily and effectively in just under two hours. What I really found irritating - exasperating, even, were all the spectators clogging everywhere up - so long as they had a vantage point then the emergency services could wait their turn... Fascinating to watch, and well worth it.\",\n",

       "     'content': \"It says a lot – or very little – about Big Gold Brick that it is an example of the book being better than the movie, even though the ‘book’ is completely fictional – not its content, mind you, but its very existence. The film, narrated by Samuel Liston (Emory Cohen), is an account of the experiences that inspired him to write a novel called “With Gold Bricks” (a title as arbitrary as that of the movie itself); a tome so hefty as to give the impression of depth, just like the movie’s 132-minute running time gives the illusion of substance. The truth is, however, that director Brian Petsos’s script can’t be said to barely scrape the surface because it’s too shallow to even have a surface to scrape.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat we have here is essentially a collection of loose ends and unresolved plot points. We are introduced to a group of characters who are each given a couple of personality traits in lieu of an actual personality, as well as backstories that could fit in a cue card – they sure sound like they are being read right off one – and are never developed in the slightest. Of one it is said that “His penchant for mischief hadn't yet become a serious cause for concern”. Well, guess what? It never does. Of another one we are told that “Her growing sorrow helped turn occasional drinking into frequent cocaine use”. Other than a “mini breakdown” (emphasis on “mini”), she is never sorrowful, or high, or even tipsy – in fact, this character exists exclusively to provide a last second romantic interest.\\r\\n\\r\\nSamuel himself opens the movie telling us that “I never believed in anything really. And then I met Floyd [Andy García]”. Whether he now believes in something, and if so, what that is, or how his meeting with Floyd influenced his current beliefs, is never made clear. Nor is the nature of the Santa Claus doll with which Samuel has conversations that may be real or may be imagined – who the hell knows? In any case, the doll disappears halfway through the movie and is never seen of heard from again.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so on and so forth. Again and again connections between two things are hinted at, but a cause-and-effect relationship is never established. Characters do and say things that come out of nowhere and lead straight back there. There is no rhyme or reason to anything that happens, nor is there any method to the madness. We can’t like or care about any of the people in the movie because they remain until the end unknowable ciphers, and the movie itself, while not necessarily boring, is too long and uneventful to actually be entertaining. Nothing to see here, really.\",\n",

       "     'content': 'Juliette Binoche is \"Marianne\", a woman looking for work after her marriage has failed and she is left pretty much broke. The employment agency recommends she becomes something along the lines of a \"domestic apparatus operator\" (i.e. a minimum wage cleaner). Talk about back-breaking work? Anyway, gradually she finds her feet and falls in with other, similarly situated, folks - notably the affable \"Cèdric\" (Didier Pupin) with whom she bonds a little (platonically), and \"Chrystèle\" (a strong performance from Hélène Lambert). It is the latter who manages to get \"Marianne\" a job cleaning the ferry between Portsmouth and Ouistreham where they work servicing the guest cabins - 4 minutes per cabin! Now I have used this ferry once or twice, so at this point the reality of the film - and of the really tough jobs done by these labourers (for that is certainly what they are) starts to kick in. They have a camaraderie and an esprit de corps that defiantly stands up to the pretty difficult working environment in which they must function. Lambert, especially, but Lèa Carne\\'s \"Marilou\" and Evelyn Porèe\\'s team-leading \"Nadège\" all contribute well to the general sense of just how hard these folks toil, and on what tiny incomes they are expected to get by. The twist? Well, midway through, we learn that \"Marianne\" has quite a different agenda to that introduced at the top of the film, and what conflict there is comes from that realisation by her friends who must come to terms with her true identity. Some applaud whilst other this see as a betrayal. Binoche is convincing here; and the film offers us a pretty scathing attack on not just the employers who pay next to nothing, but on the travellers and general public who seem incapable of flushing a toilet or tidying up after themselves. It does plod a bit; and the ending is both rushed and a little disappointing - but as a critique on an employment sub-culture which many of us just sleep through, it is well worth a watch.',\n",

       "     'content': 'Told by way of a rather denouement-wrecking retrospective, this is a particularly weak development of Alexandre Dumas\\' exciting \"Three Musketeers\" story. Jonathan Hansler (he is the \"and\" in the titles at the start of the film, so expectations for a feast of drama were already pretty low) is an elderly d\\'Artagnan regaling his tales of derring-do as a youngster to a would-be successor \"Philippe\" (Nathan McGowran). The arrival in Paris, his introduction to \"Porthos\", \"Aramis\" and \"Athos\" and their perilous rivalry with the guards of Cardinal Richelieu - represented here by his thoroughly un-menacing henchman \"Rochefort\" (Sean Cronin) and the equally un-intimidating \"Milady\" (Mollie Hindle) - is all faithful enough to the book, but boy is this a very wordy exercise. The sword play looks like it was choreographed in a sixth form college and I am afraid that handsome as he may be, Matt Ingram-Jones makes even Logan Lerman look good. To give it some dues, it\\'s clearly been produced on a very modest budget, and those taking part do try quite hard; but I am afraid it has college drama project written all over it. This is a great story that should be up for reimagining now and again, but somehow this just won\\'t be one that anyone - including, I dare say, those actually in it, will wish to recall to their grandchildren. Straight to video, as they used to say...',\n",

       "     'content': 'This movie may be A Banquet, but it’s no feast. It has no fat in it, but no meat either. It’s lean but not muscular – nothing but skin and bones. It might whet your appetite for similar but heartier offerings such as Take Shelter, Horse Girl, or the German Kreuzweg – but then why not just skip the apéritif and go straight for the main course?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe action, such as it is, is triggered by the rise of a big, red moon that sends Betsey (Jessica Alexander), who may or may not be the only one who can see it, into an on-and-off trance. This reminds me of the blood moon prophecies by Christian preachers John Hagee and Mark Biltz, related to a series of four full moons in 2014 and 2015. The prophecies stated that a tetrad (a series of four consecutive lunar eclipses) which began with the April 2014 lunar eclipse was the beginning of the end times as described in the Bible in the Book of Joel, Acts 2:20, complete with the Second Coming of Christ and the Rapture.\\r\\n\\r\\nI’m reminded of this, not because Betsey also starts vaguely prophesying the end of the world, nor because at some point someone appears to be raptured, but because the tetrad came and went and nothing really happened, and the same can be said of A Banquet once the end credits start to roll. Now, at least Hagee’s and Biltz’s prophecies had slight connection with reality; the lunar eclipses were real, albeit with perfectly reasonable explanations – and ‘explanations’ is something sorely missing from this movie.\\r\\n\\r\\nDon’t get me wrong; a little mystery can go a long way, but writer Justin Bull and director Ruth Paxton can’t be bothered to even begin scratching the lunar surface, as it were. What this red moon hides on its dark side is anybody’s guess. I’m not saying they should have come up with their own elaborate mythology like in Equus (although that is very nice touch), but they could have easily resorted to an existing religion, as Kreuzweg does; either way, give us a frame of reference.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere, Betsey claims to have been “chosen”, but never specifies by whom. Her brand of eschatology amounts to little more than some refrain about “stars burning”. All things considered, it’s actually fitting, all this talk about the moon and the stars, because A Banquet is all atmosphere, and it quickly fizzles out into the ether. The same applies to the perfunctory attempt at ambiguity made in the form of Betsey’s skeptical grandmother; neither she nor Betsey’s myriad doctors make a big deal out of Betsey’s ability to keep a steady weight without eating. If true, that would be a medical wonder; if not – but let’s just that the possibility that she’s committing a pious fraud is never brought up. By the way, the goal of fasting is that it should entail a sacrifice (as in, once again, Krezweg); Betsey, on the other hand, is just not hungry.',\n",

       "     'content': 'Near the start of this film, we hear a weather forecast on the car radio advising sunny spells are imminent. Well they didn\\'t come, nor are there really any other sunny moments in this story. Set on the rather dark, bleak and wintry Isle of Lewis, we meet \"Phil\" (auteur Bouli Landers) who works as a general factotum with \"Brian\" (Andrew Still) who is the grandson of the smallholding owner \"Angus\" (Julian Glover). The two workers bond well enough during their largely outdoor, and muddy, endeavours and also over a pint afterwards where the former man discovers that the young man\\'s aunt \"Millie\" (Michelle Fairley) is looked upon rather disdainfully by others in their small community. It\\'s only when \"Phil\" suffers a stroke on the beach, that this lady comes forward to help his recuperation, and in the process tells quite a big \"white\" lie that sets the scene for the rest of this drama. It\\'s a very slow burn with, frankly, a very thin plot but the acting is quite genuine and the island environment and tightly knit family scenario does add a bit of richness to the increasingly predicable outcome. I\\'ve seen Fairley on stage a few times and she is a good actress at delivering the less is more style, but here there are just too many lingering shots, driving to and fro, having a cigarette meaningfully - without really developing the characters enough, nor really explaining while the originally Belgian visitor is there in the first place. It\\'s nicely shot, but just rather unremarkable.',\n",

       "     'content': 'Déborah Lukumuena is really quite good here as the wresting bodyguard assigned to look after the larger than life (quite literally) actor \"Georges\" (Gérard Depardieu) whose unreliable attitude to work is leaving him with debts, law suits and precious few options. The template for the story is quite good, and both leading roles have character to them, but somehow the whole thing just doesn\\'t ignite. The story itself is an hybrid of quite a few similar themes with a dialogue that fails to impress. Lukumuena is quite a mean wrestler, but the familial sub-plots just clutter up the dynamic that is at it\\'s best when it is just the two on screen. Even then it\\'s still not especially engaging. Depardieu has a star quality, there\\'s no denying that - but that is just not enough to raise this from mediocrity. Watchable, but equally forgettable - except, perhaps, for the odd looking fish!',\n",

Also on the trip is \"Lohan\" (Jules Bahoul - if Eddie Redmayne ever needs a stunt double?). Now the two men don\\'t quite hit it off at the start. The former has clearly undergone some sort of trauma in his recent past and so is usually topped up with anti-depressants. \"Lohan\" is an asthmatic. Gradually the two start to realise that they have one - quite significant - thing in common and that gradually developing bond provides the thrust for this really rather unremarkable drama. It has a start and a middle that we will all recognise from many films before but the ending is frankly quite horrific and sadly, from a character perspective, rather under-developed. Quite what director Théodore Tomasz was trying to do here was not at all clear to me and that rather disappointed. Still, it\\'s quite well photographed and we do get a warming sense of their burgeoning intimacy as the hour this takes moves along effortlessly. I don\\'t know - it\\'s just as if the writers were trying shock and it mis-fired at the end. See what you think, they are all very easy on the eye and it\\'s just about worth an hour of your time.',\n",
