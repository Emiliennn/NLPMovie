Despite his reluctance; Dewey gets involved and tells Sam the \u201crules\u201d which would indicate the killer might be someone she knows and soon everyone in her and Tara\u2019s circle becomes suspect even as the deaths start to increase.\r\n\r\nThis allows for some of the best moments of the film as the characters make references to several other modern and past horror franchises and discuss things from online Trolls, rabid fans, and other Pop Culture references which provides some tongue in cheek humor about the series and also establishes the world of \u201cScream\u201d as one where people are well-versed in horror films old and new and have modified the rules based on sequel, prequel, and \u201cRequel\u201d rules for films.\r\n\r\nAs tensions and body count mounts; Gayle, Dewey, and Sidney (Neve Campbell) must face their fears to stop Ghostface before it is too late.\r\n\r\nWhile the final act of the film is very over the top and at times absurd; it does provide plenty of the elements that fans have come to expect from the series. I was able to accurately see and predict almost all of the twists very early in the film and did not have many surprises as the film unfolded; I think many will still find enough enjoyment watching the tale unfold as after four films I have a pretty good idea of the formula for the series and also have many years of this as I saw the twists in \u201cThe Sixth Sense\u201d and \u201cThe Village\u201d very early in the films so I just seem to have a knack for this sort of thing.\r\n\r\nWhile it does not break much in the way of new ground; the film does deliver what fans have come to expect and I did find in more enjoyable than \u201cScream 3\u201d and there was more than enough to keep me entertained. There have been rumors that a sixth film has already been planned and if so: I will be more than ready for more.\r\n\r\n3.5 out of 5",

I couldn't recommend it more.\"\r\n\r\nRating: A-",

I\u2019ll see and support any new _Scream_ film or TV series that comes along because of it. I know this new installment was successful ($88.4 million worldwide box office gross as of this writing) and some enjoyed it, but it is honestly my least favorite in the franchise.\r\n\r\nThis new film feels like it\u2019s trying too hard to be one of the original _Scream_ films when it should have just been more of its own thing. This is something the film addresses, but originality should always triumph over retreading familiar territory; especially when it seems like its kills are being plunged into the same stab wounds.\r\n\r\nFull review: https://hubpages.com/entertainment/Scream-2022-Review-Movies-Make-Psychos-More-Imitative",

I'd rank this third in the franchise I suppose, behind the original and Scream 2 (for all that movie's flaws, it has a soft spot for me). Not great but worth watching once. **3.25/5**",

It reinvented horror and launched a franchise of sequels of varying quality. And this newest one is the best since the first! It captured all the fun of the first. It kept the stakes high by bringing back the original cast and proving that no one is truly safe. The directors had fun baiting the audience with every slasher trope they could. Tense music would rise every time a character walked past a dark doorway or opened a cabinet to hide the view from the hall - naturally, that is when the killer is standing on the other side but not in Scream! Playing with the tropes in a fun, self-aware way is what Scream is all about, and Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett nailed it.",

                    "content": "Some things never change. This can be good and also bad. Bad like Audibly Sharp knives (i.e., blades that make a sharpening noise when being whisked through thin air), or like when former deputy Dewey Riley (David Arquette) says \u201cYou have to shoot 'em in the head, or they always come back.\u201d Of course, the very existence of the new Scream is irrefutable proof that they will come back regardless. This movie is slasher history repeating itself in more ways than one; in addition to revisiting this particular franchise, it borrows a key plot point from Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare \u2013 that I will not reveal but which you may have inkling about if you are, like me, a student of the genre.\r\n\r\nAll of the above notwithstanding, Scream \u201822 is overall more good than bad. True to its roots, this iteration serves as a deconstruction of the current state of mainstream horror cinema. Specifically, it is a textbook example of a \u201crequel\u201d \u2013 like the last couple of Halloweens, or the recent Texas Chainsaw Massacre \u2013, and by \u2018textbook\u2019 I mean that it actually includes a scene where a character literally explains what a requel is and how it works. I also like that it lampshades one of my least favorite tropes, which I call Chekhov's Inhaler.\r\n\r\nI just compared it to Halloween and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but the fact is that Scream \u201822 comes to join the much better company of Wes Craven\u2019s New Nightmare and last year\u2019s Candyman (suitably, the movie is dedicated to Craven\u2019s memory and gives Jordan Peele a shoutout). This Scream\u2019s oft-repeated mantra is \u201calways go back to the original,\u201d and that\u2019s sage advice because, like Nightmare on Elm Street, this franchise is a brainchild of Craven that began life as thinking man\u2019s horror only to get progressively dumbed down with each new entry \u2013 unlike, say, Friday the 13th, which was born stupid.\r\n\r\nThankfully, this film has been made by people with knowledge of and respect for their source material, and who don\u2019t underestimate the audience\u2019s intelligence. Consequently, when characters send text messages, the words appear on their phone screens as opposed to our movie and TV screens, and when a someone is stabbed, they spill real fake blood instead of a stream of red pixels (and in an age where CGI is the norm, any horror movie that uses practical effects instantly doubles its visceral impact). I will only add that, also like New Nightmare and Candyman \u201821, Scream \u201822 is as much of a return to form as it is a fitting farewell, so here\u2019s hoping that it will live up to its promise that \u201cAfter tonight, no more books, no more movies, no more f***ing Ghostface.\u201d",

Instead we get this lackluster dud of a film that is boring to look at and is mostly massively unfunny while making most of the characters \u2013 old and new \u2013 forgettable. When Zee first meets Crash and Eddie, Buck says something along the lines of, \u201cWhat they lack in courage they make up for with bumbling ineptitude.\u201d That is all _The Adventures of Buck Wild_ is; an unnecessary animated excursion into bumbling ineptitude.\r\n\r\n**Full review:** https://hubpages.com/entertainment/The-Ice-Age-Adventures-of-Buck-Wild-2022-Review-An-Inept-Spleen-Powered-Blemish-of-Animation",

The film ultimately collapses under its own potential resulting in a bland and flavorless concoction. Every side character is just interesting enough to pique your interest and the film is written in a way where it seems like everyone is a suspect, but every potentially exciting aspect dissolves before it has a chance to light up the sky; like a really expensive firecracker that turns out to be a dud.\r\n\r\nThe film may be worth a look for Mel Gibson\u2019s flashy, boisterous, and drunkenly absurd performance. The mystery in Last Looks is essentially comparable to trying to discover the expiration date on a can of mystery meat that has lost its label; it may be life-threatening but is otherwise a bore to experience by others. \r\n\r\nFull review: https://hubpages.com/entertainment/Last-Looks-2022-Review-A-Bland-Overstuffed-Mystery",

They are the film's major plus. I'm struggling for other positives, cinematography at a push?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I came away from watching feeling underwhelmed. The second half really drags, not helped by an extremely lame 'twist'. The first half isn't perfect but does hold potential, once the main bunch eventually team up it's more interesting. The editing is a little iffy, too.\r\n\r\nThere are quite a few talky scenes that aren't worthwhile at all, especially early on with Chastain and Sebastian Stan. Things improve when the action sequences get underway, not that they are anything extraordinary but what we see is satisfactory; it's the bits in between that let this 2022 release down.\r\n\r\n6/10, despite the well performing cast; who almost made me give this 7/10.",

I guess there was potential and maybe under a better director would've been at least an entertaining flick, but in the end I found it to be forgettable. **2.25/5**",

However, the generic screenplay, poor dialogues, and barely developed characters turn a film with much potential into another disappointment from Simon Kinberg (The New Mutants).\r\n\r\nThe action sequences actually include interesting choreography, but the use of quick cuts and shaky cam doesn't always work favorably. The narrative is loaded with the usual formulas of the respective genre, and some attempts to approach the theme of feminism efficiently fall flat.\r\n\r\nPersonally, it's saved by the fact that it was primarily filmed in real locations, helping with the entertainment levels.\"\r\n\r\nRating: C",

The cast was stellar, and the performances were solid. Unfortunately, the 355 stumbles with a stale, unimaginative script that is incredibly predictable and keeps the peril and danger from feeling very perilous or dangerous. I didn\u2019t finish the movie feeling I had wasted my time, but I couldn\u2019t say I would recommend it. Jessica Chastain, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, and the rest of the cast seemed to have fun working on this project together, and their chemistry was entertaining. Still, the trite dialogue kept all of it from being great. I wish The 355 had been trusted with a bigger budget and a more experienced director. It had enough strengths that even with all its flaws, it was a decent film, but it could have easily been a great movie.",

Egged on by the ambitious \"Labarthe\" (Pablo Schreiber) he believes that he can live forever if her manages to get hold of a mermaid and - well, he pinches her life force. Snag is, though, his own daughter \"Mary-Josephe\" (Kaya Scodelerio) is not so supportive of this scheme when she discovers this distressed sea creature and so, of course, off we head into the turbulent waters of familial discord before a whopping great power ballad at the end. William Hurt crops up here, too, and Benjamin Walker provides some eye candy - but the story is Disney-lite, there is way too much verbiage and although Brosnan tries to ham it all up, he just looks like he couldn't care less about any of it - a feeling with which I could pretty readily associate. It does look good, the costumes and Versailles look lovely but the rest of it is straight to video.",

I don't think that either.\r\n\r\nThere are reviews calling this the 'worst shark movie ever made' and a 'waste of time'. Though it is definitely flawed, I wouldn't even go near that. When people say that, they must either be referring to the entire film or just the third act, because the sharks really don't even show up until then (this is actually a bit of a compliment).\r\n\r\nYes, the CGI sharks don't look their best, especially at the end. But I'd guess that the VFX team didn't have the required time to perfect them. And (*spoilers*), the ending with the shark killed by chomping on an anchor, feels like it was just pulled from \"The Shallows\".\r\n\r\nBut, there are actually some great (and even amazing) aspects to this film. Though the third act is where it all just kind of falls apart, the story is decent and the build up to the characters getting stranded at sea, and the tension of when their supplies and shelter get smaller in nearly every scene, is done pretty well. And the cinematography, especially in the beginning, looks absolutely gorgeous and professional.",

In fact, the lead character of this movie was the worse part! Her frantic screams, frustrated outbursts, and emotional moments made the typical c-list shark movie actors look much better. It is shocking how annoying her performance was. On top of that, the green screen was very noticeable and overused, making me wonder how much water even made it into this movie. I am surprised that this director also made The Princess, which was a well-done, fun action movie. What happened to this movie, then? The Requin isn\u2019t just a bad movie; it is bad for a bad shark movie! Don\u2019t waste your time.",

                    "content": "I\u2019m sorry to report that Alyssa Milano does not forego her long-standing \u2018no nudity clause\u2019 in Brazen \u2014 and I\u2019m more sorry for her than for me (after all, I\u2019ve seen Embrace of the Vampire), because that\u2019s about the only thing that could save this mess. Milano is Grace Miller, authoress of thriller novels. Here is an excerpt from her most recent masterpiece, titled Brazen Virtue:\r\n\r\n\"She did not expect to die that night. Sara Bowman was precise in everything, and dying was not on her agenda. She had no enemies that she knew of. In general, his life was quite ordinary. Yet there she was, lying in a pool of her own blood. The manner of her death violent, even deranged. Who would want to kill the ordinary Sara Bowman? And then it dawned on her. What if she wasn\u2019t ordinary? What if she had a secret life?\"\r\n\r\nIt would have to be a very secret secret life indeed if not even \u201cSarah\u201d herself was aware of it. It turns out that Brazen is based on a novel also called Brazen Virtue by Nora Roberts; I\u2019m not familiar with her work, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if her books opened with the phrase \u201cIt was a dark and stormy night\u201d or some variation thereof.\r\n\r\nIn addition to a purveyor of purple prose, Grace is a dispenser of clumsy exposition, like when she tells her sister Kathleen (Emilie Ullerup) that \u201cLast I heard you were addicted to pills and you abandoned your son.\u201d Something tells me this is not news to Kathleen, who is an English teacher at an upper-class boys\u2019 high school: \u201cNext week\u2019s essay will be on Hamlet. How would Hamlet feel in our digital age?\r\n\r\nI\u2019m pretty sure Ethan Hawke already answered this question, and the answer wasn\u2019t very compelling (besides, a better question would be how would Romeo feel in the digital age, considering that a simple SMS would have saved him a lot of trouble).\r\n\r\nWould you believe that Kathleen herself just happens to have a double life of her own? Well, she does; her alter ego is Desiree, a web cam dominatrix. Wait, what? I guess all her customers must be naughty little boys, because for a fetish based on discipline, this is incredibly lazy.\r\n\r\nAnyway, Kathleen soon gets sent to web cam heaven, and Grace hijacks her sister\u2019s homicide investigation, which is nominally led by Detective Ed Jennings (Sam Page) \u2014 who conveniently lives next-door to Kathleen \u2014 and his partner, Detective Ben Parker (Malachi Weier), who may be named after Spiderman\u2019s uncle, but he looks like the lead singer in a Melvins cover band.\r\n\r\nGrace talks Ed and Ben\u2019s boss, Captain Rivera (Alison Araya) into appointing her a \u201cconsultant\u201d on the case (someone\u2019s been watching too much Lucifer). Grace justifies this claiming that \u201cI have an instinct for motive. I mean, that\u2019s why my books are so successful. I can enter the mind of a murderer, especially those who attack women.\u201d\r\n\r\nEd, who is present and opposes the idea, fails to point out that Grace would be a pretty lousy writer (well, lousier) if she couldn\u2019t freely enter the mind of a killer that she made up in the first place.\r\nUnchecked, Grace adds, \u201cDo you know how long it took the NYPD to find the Times Square Rapist? Eight months. And I went in, studied the case, and they caught the guy three days later.\u201d Again, it doesn\u2019t cross Ed\u2019s mind to call this a coincidence or suggest that the guy was caught thanks to those eight months of police work, and not Grace\u2019s three days.\r\n\r\nThe Captain, who must have found her badge in a cereal box, is sold, however; \u201cGrace, I read your books from cover to cover as soon as I can get my hands on them. You truly are one of the most cunning profilers out there.\u201d Thankfully, the scene ends before the brownosing becomes literal.\r\n\r\nWhat I don\u2019t understand is why director Monika Mitchell \u2014 and that a woman directed this, as it were, brazen display of pseudo-feminism is most baffling \u2014 goes to such lengths to promote Grace as a prodigious detective mind when she never even comes close to determining the killer\u2019s identity or motive (despite having \u201clots of ideas\u201d about it), or why screenwriters Edithe Swensen and Donald Martin force Milano to say, with all the sincerity she can muster, that Grace\u2019s novels are \u201cabout the exploitation of women and misogyny and patriarchy and how we do very little to protect the most vulnerable\u201d, only to have her catch the villain by literally using her body as bait. \r\n\r\nIt may contain no full-frontal nudity, but Brazen is nonetheless one of the most embarrassing movies Milano has ever been in (for what it\u2019s worth, she\u2019s a stone-cold MILF, though).",

                    "content": "Werewolf Castle is a medieval fantasy that strives to evoke an air of authenticity. This is a film made in the same spirit as, say, Excalibur, but on a much smaller scale \u2014 and with werewolves.\r\n\r\nThis is a B-movie at best, but it deserves an A for effort. The filmmakers respect the audience too much to allow even the slightest shred of cheap CGI to creep into the film.\r\n\r\nIts Haunted Forest is all the more haunting for being an actual forest (the Brecon Beacons mountain range in south Wales), and the titular castle is, or at least was long ago, the real thing. I\u2019ll take well-preserved ruins (and the state of the structure can even be justified within the con- text of the story) over a phony-looking computer-generated palace any day.\r\n\r\nAnd now the damn veggies. The werewolves are clearly People in Suits, and that\u2019s the good news; the bad news is that they all wear identical masks, eternally frozen in the same expression, as if they are always mid growl.\r\n\r\nThis must perforce confine the werewolves to the background, which has the upside of shifting the focus to the human characters \u2014 among whom I include the leader of the lycanthropes, who wisely retains his hominid appearance at all times.\r\n\r\nWerewolf Castle tells a straightforward, deceptively simple story (in 90 lean minutes). Werewolves in general symbolize the Apollonian/Dionysian dichotomy, but the filmmakers establish this duality before and beyond a literal transformation.\r\n\r\nThe young hero, Thorfinn (Peter Lofsgard), leaves his younger brother to the mercy of the wolves so that he can cavort with a plump wench, whom he also abandons to her fate once the monsters attack their village.\r\n\r\nThus, joining the \u201cgreat warrior knights\u201d Hamelin Wiltshire (Tim Cartwright), Thomas Fairhurst (Greg Draven), Osmund Blakewood (Derek Nelson) and the awesomely named Hal Skullsplitter (Jay O'Connell), is for Thorfinn the only way to redeem himself and fulfill Hal\u2019s words: \u201cWhere once you were a coward you can now be brave, and where once people took you for a fool, new people might recognize you as a hero.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis movie is by no means perfect, but it has a lot more heart and brains than, say, the neverending, boring, and pointless The Green Knight.\r\n\r\nIf one is forgiving of its rudimentary werewolves, and willing to let them take the place of dragons in an Arthurian pastiche, then there is much to enjoy at Werewolf Castle.",

It\u2019s a classic case of the audience knowing more than the characters. Helping with the tension is keeping the Germans speaking German. \r\n\r\nThe film has an impending doom about it. It's Titanic meets a world war with lots of people being wrong in their assurances of the future. This is fine, they're saying. The tension between the two leads Legat and von Hartmann reflects the tensions between the countries yet somehow in reverse. They are trying to reconcile while their countries irrevocably turn to war. The script is good enough not just to make these two characters overly simple.\r\n\r\nMcKay finds himself again being a messenger right back in the wars (after after he starred in 1917) with the world being on the verge of WWII. He just must be made of the right stuff - or at least the running stuff.\r\nIrons thrives as the miscalculating Chamberlain PM, while the film shows him to be harshly treated by history. Everyone seems anxious as if there was a war on or something.\r\n\r\nThe theme of personal need versus national duty comes up as well as the sacrifices required come in opposite directions when some are sacrificing for the country and others are against it. The film serves as inspiration and a warning for future skirmishes. \r\n\r\nViewers can be glad the filmmakers resisted the temptation of calling this Hitler\u2019s Translator. It\u2019s an effective international thriller since the audience know the ending and its accompanying tragedy.",

The story focuses on the 1938 Munich Agreement. However, the director embraces the fictional way more than the historical one, and the film becomes an enjoyable drama enriched with some taste of a thriller. **- The Story -** In autumn 1938, Europe was on the brink of war. Hitler claimed back the territory of Sudetenland, belonging at that moment to Czechoslovakia. If Hitler invades the Czech, France and Britain must protect them. Prime Minister Chamberlain and his staff have less than 24 hours to find a diplomatic solution and prevent a tragic European conflict. Behind the lines, two old friends, Hugh Legat and Paul von Hartmann weave the web to keep the peace and change the course of history. The solution seems to be a quick agreement to give back to the Germans the Sudetenland. But will it be enough? Who are Hugh and Paul? And what is behind this story and the conspiracy? - **Full analysis at https://www.spotamovie.com/munich-the-edge-of-war-movie-review-and-explanation-2021-movie/**",

                    "content": "Redeeming Love looks great. It features great locations shot with great cinematography, but that\u2019s about all director D.J. Caruso can do to entice us to keep watching. It\u2019s terrific to see a story unfolding in a non-CGI, true-to-life setting, even if it\u2019s Cape Town standing in for California (but then some of the greatest westerns were filmed in Europe, so there\u2019s that), but while this movie arguably achieves the western look, it fails to conjure up any sort of western feel.\r\n\r\nThe script concerns a Hooker with a Heart of Gold known as Angel, who is so sought after that the local Madame, who calls herself Duchess, holds a daily raffle to determine which lucky slack-jawed gold miners \u2013 there is more than one winner per day \u2013 get to hold sexual congress with her. This is such a cumbersome arrangement that it actually gets in the way of the plot, so that co-writers Francine Rivers and Caruso Hand Wave it not long after they have introduced it.\r\n\r\nSo-called \u201cdirt farmer\u201d Michael Hosea becomes smitten with Angel, so what does he do to get near her? Does he buy all the numbers in the raffle? Does he have the raffle rigged? No and no; he simply \u201cpays double\u201d. That\u2019s it. Why this hasn\u2019t occurred to at least some of the yokels who form a daily scrum outside the brothel is anybody\u2019s guess. Another good question is where Michael, who is not a miner, finds enough \u201cgold dust\u201d to gain access to Angel on three different occasions.\r\n\r\nAngel wants nothing to do with Michael owing to a deep-seated hatred and distrust of men, which is established in a series of flashbacks that are so many and so long they could make up an entire, separate movie all by themselves. They are also the reason that Redeeming Love unnecessarily breaks the 120-minute mark. But the oddest part about these flashbacks is that they show Angel escaping a life of compulsory whoredom only to enter a life of voluntary whoredom. Twice. Maybe even thrice, but that last time is once again against her will. In any case, it gets to be quite repetitive after a while.\r\n\r\nIt is only after Angel gets the tar beaten out of her by the Duchess\u2019s lackey Magowan that she relents and agrees to marry Michael \u2013 but first he has to pay off her \u201cdebt\u201d to the Duchess, and the irony that he literally buys Angel off in order to make an honest woman out of her is lost on Michael and Caruso alike.\r\n\r\nRedeeming Love\u2019s greatest achievement, other than its photography, is how well it masks its biblical pedigree. According to Wikipedia this is a \u201cChristian Western\u201d based on an homonymous novel by Rivers (unread by me, though it wouldn\u2019t surprise if she had first published it under the pseudonym F.R. Ancine), which in turn is inspired by an obscure Old Testament book \u2013 not that you would even guess at any of this by watching the movie, and that\u2019s actually a good thing. It may be long and boring, but at least it\u2019s not overtly preachy.",

His pal Anthony Hayes and he try to move it, but it's just too big. Plan? Well Hayes decides to head to the nearest town to try and procure some heavy lifting equipment and leaves Zac to keep watch. Hmmm? Well, anyway Hayes isn't exactly rushing back to his friend who is gradually running out of food, water, having hallucinations, fending off wild dogs and even a rogue Irish women as his grasp on reality starts to slip... Efron is actually not bad as the man who gradually succumbs to despair and dehydration, but the story plods along far too slowly for almost eighty minutes before the last ten minutes provide a denouement with a bit of a twist to the tale. It is good that Efron is pushing himself away from his pretty boy roles - indeed the make-up folks here do such a good job that I doubt even a biblical leper would welcome him into their home, but the story all takes way too long to get going and the it, quite literally, crawls along. The production does look good - the desert photography has an almost naturally sepia colour to it that emphasises just how hostile this terrain is and the narrative does say something about the degree to which greed is hard wired into our psyche though; and the perils we will endure or permit to obtain wealth. Thought provoking? Maybe, but it's still really quite a wearisome watch and I'm not sure I would bother again.",
